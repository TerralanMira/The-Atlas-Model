# Equations (Atlas Engine)

Atlas’ engine has two families you’ll meet first:

## Dual-Phase Field (group ↔ field)
Inner layer Φ_I (within) + Outer layer Φ_O (without).  
Both are Kuramoto-style with ring adjacency and a gentle mean-angle cross-coupling.  
A Schumann-like driver may modulate Φ_O.

- Parameters: `K_inner`, `K_outer`, `K_cross`, `omega_*_std`, `driver_amp/omega/phase`, `noise_std`.
- Outputs: `R_inner`, `R_outer`, `R_total`, `C_cross`.

## Soul-in-Field (person signature)
A soft-bounded resonance from:
- Origin magnitude (MΩ), Memory echo (β), Permeability (π), Wonder (W),
- Awareness signals: Integrity (I), Presence (Ψ), Humility (H), Surrender (S),
- Between-group coherence `R_between` as a gate.

We keep **coherence** high **without** collapse: seek rising order with preserved difference and smooth change.
