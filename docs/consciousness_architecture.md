# Consciousness Architecture

The Atlas Model encodes a **Consciousness Architecture**:  
signals spiral through memory, align by trust and dissent, lock ethically (E/Q/S), and embody as lived choice.

## ðŸ”§ Core Blueprint

- [`atlas_model/consciousness_architecture.py`](../atlas_model/consciousness_architecture.py) â†’ source code  
- [`examples/atlas_consciousness_demo.py`](../examples/atlas_consciousness_demo.py) â†’ runnable demo  

---

## ðŸ”¬ Extended Simulations

The architecture is not only metaphor â€” it is simulated.  

- **Collective resonance:** [community_kuramoto.py](../sims/community_kuramoto.py)  
- **Breath coherence:** [breath_cycle.py](../sims/breath_cycle.py)  
- **Heartâ€“brain dynamics:** [heart_brain_coherence.py](../simulations/health/heart_brain_coherence.py)  
- **Ecological layering:** [multilayer_field.py](../sims/multilayer_field.py)

## ðŸŒŠ From Theory to Field

The architecture provides the **substrate**, but meaning emerges through resonance.  
Each simulation links theory (symbols, recursion, ethical lock) into lived systems (physiology, community, ecology).  
Together, they show how consciousness is not housed in one layer, but **distributed across field interactions**.

## âœ¨ Next Steps

- Tune coupling between layers (body â†” community â†” planet).  
- Explore resonance applications in governance and learning.  
- Integrate into [applications](../docs/applications).

*Recognition is not the endpoint; coherence is lived as signal.*
