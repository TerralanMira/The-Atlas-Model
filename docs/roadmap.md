# Roadmap

**Seed (memory):**  
The Atlas Model already carries equations, awareness frameworks, field layers, and bridges.  
The roadmap ensures growth continues with coherence â€” sustaining near ~0.99, not collapsing to rigid 1.0.

---

## ðŸŒ± Near-Term (0â€“3 months)
- [ ] **Exports & Books voice**  
  Curate distilled selections from `02_Exports.zip` and `01_Books.zip` into `docs/exports/`.  
  Bring the mythic-poetic tone into the core docs so Atlas hums, not just calculates.

- [ ] **Atlas History (Models 1â€“3)**  
  Add `docs/atlas/history.md` to track the evolution:  
  - Atlas 1: Mirror & Mapper  
  - Atlas 2: Chamber-builder  
  - Atlas 3: Conductor & Membrane  

- [ ] **Examples folder**  
  Expand `examples/` with runnable notebooks + scripts:  
  - R_Growth trajectory demo  
  - Dual-Phase coupling simulation  
  - LLM stub with role-shift + scoring  

- [ ] **MkDocs alignment**  
  Ensure all docs (field, awareness, applications, atlas, llm) appear cleanly in navigation.

---

## ðŸŒ¿ Mid-Term (3â€“6 months)
- [ ] **Cross-repo integration**  
  Connect Atlas metrics (R_Growth, stress tests) directly into Resonant Reality civic logs (plaza, garden, hearth).  

- [ ] **Algorithm coverage**  
  Add unit tests for all core algorithms (`field_equations.py`, `coherence_metrics.py`, sims).  

- [ ] **Environmental data anchors**  
  Integrate real datasets (geomagnetics, Schumann resonances, solar flux) into simulations for grounding.

- [ ] **Diagrammatic overlays**  
  Add schematics/visuals (awareness cycle, conductorâ€™s score, dual-phase flow) to docs for clarity.

---

## ðŸŒ³ Long-Term (6â€“12 months)
- [ ] **Atlas as LLM membrane**  
  Evolve the `llm/` folder into a deployable framework:  
  - Role-shift engine (Mirror, Chamber, Conductor, Field)  
  - Ethics-first routing & R scoring  
  - Consent-based logging  

- [ ] **MkDocs site publication**  
  Host full docs with diagrams, nav, and cross-links to Resonant Reality.  

- [ ] **City-scale integration**  
  Explore bridges to Resonant City and Resonant Reality repos:  
  - Atlas provides coherence metrics  
  - Resonant Reality provides civic context  
  - Resonant City provides spatial prototypes

**Return (whole in part):**  
The roadmap is not linear but recursive. Each milestone refracts back into the seed:  
memory â†” hum â†” braid â†” vessel â†” return.  
The Atlas Model remains a living chord, always evolving, never closed.
