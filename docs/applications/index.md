# Applications (Seeds → Forest)

This section turns Atlas dashboards into practice.  
Each application page gives:
1. **Seed** — the minimal coherent pattern.
2. **Setup** — what data or logs to create (CSV/JSON).
3. **View** — which dashboard page to render.
4. **Interpret** — what shifts to expect and how to iterate.

Pages:
- [Health](health.md)
- [Cities](cities.md)
- [Learning](learning.md)
