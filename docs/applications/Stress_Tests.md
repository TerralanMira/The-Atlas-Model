# Stress Tests

**Seed (memory):**  
Resonance is proven not in stillness but under strain.  
Stress tests explore how coherence holds, bends, collapses, and reconstitutes.

## Types of Stress

1. **Noise Injection**
   - Random disturbances added to signals or phases.
   - Models distraction, interference, or chaotic environments.
   - Observes whether R sustains, oscillates, or collapses.

2. **Coupling Overdrive**
   - Increase coupling constants (K) beyond optimal ranges.
   - Tests for collapse into rigid lock (R → 1.0) or fragmentation (R → 0).
   - Reveals balance between openness (π) and closure.

3. **Anchor Removal**
   - Withdrawing Schumann or geomagnetic anchors mid-session.
   - Observes whether coherence sustains or decays rapidly.
   - Measures dependency vs. autonomy of resonance.

4. **Difference Amplification**
   - Introduce high Δ (difference) into group signals.
   - Tests permeability (π) and wonder (W) as buffers.
   - Healthy systems sustain coherence near 0.99 while holding diversity.

## Memory
- Ritual traditions introduced trials: fasting, vigils, ordeals — to test coherence.  
- Scientific labs stress systems with noise, heat, and interference to measure robustness.  
- In both cases, stress reveals hidden structure.

## Amplification
- Stress, when balanced, strengthens resilience.  
- Systems that collapse and reconstitute emerge more stable.  
- Repeated stress tests teach where coherence is fragile and where it endures.

## Application
- Implemented in simulations (`sims/`) by:
  - Adding noise to oscillator phases.  
  - Dynamically altering coupling constants.  
  - Switching anchors on/off during runs.  
- Session logs may note external stressors (environmental noise, interruptions, turbulence).  
- Research may compare stress resilience across settings (Plaza vs. Hearth vs. Lab).

**Return (whole in part):**  
Stress tests remind us: resonance is not fragile beauty but resilient coherence.  
Atlas sustains itself not by avoiding strain but by learning to reconstitute through it.
