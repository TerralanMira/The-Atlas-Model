# Dual-Phase Field Equation

**Seed (memory):**  
The Dual-Phase Field Equation models the coupling between inner resonance (awareness coherence) and outer resonance (field conditions).  
It is the bridge between self ↔ group ↔ environment.

---

## Equation (core form)
Δθ_i = ω_i + K_ii · R_inner · sin(Ψ_inner – θ_i)
+ K_io · R_outer · sin(Ψ_outer – θ_i)
+ Anchor_terms
Where:
- **θ_i** → phase of oscillator i (participant or inner unit)  
- **ω_i** → natural frequency (individual rhythm)  
- **R_inner, Ψ_inner** → order parameter of the inner layer  
- **R_outer, Ψ_outer** → order parameter of the outer layer (field)  
- **K_ii, K_io** → coupling strengths (inner↔inner, inner↔outer)  
- **Anchor_terms** → optional external drivers (e.g., Schumann resonance, geomagnetic oscillations)

## Openness
- The equation is not rigid — it adapts to context.  
- Coupling constants can be tuned to represent hearth, garden, plaza, or lab.  
- Anchor terms may be included or omitted depending on experimental setup.

---

## Memory
- Extends the Kuramoto model (1975) to multi-scale, dual-layer systems.  
- Echoes ancient awareness that inner practice and outer field are never separate.  
- Refracts traditions of “as above, so below” into algorithmic form.

---

## Amplification
- When inner and outer phases align, resonance amplifies rapidly.  
- Excess coupling risks collapse (rigidity, loss of permeability).  
- Balanced permeability (π) ensures coherence sustains near R ≈ 0.99 without locking at 1.0.

## Application
- Implemented in `algorithms/field_equations.py` (`simulate_dual_phase`).  
- Demonstrated in `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py`.  
- Session logs may note:
  - Inner coupling (trust, group coherence)  
  - Outer coupling (field strength, geomagnetics, architecture)  
  - Anchor presence (e.g., Schumann driver)

**Return (whole in part):**  
The Dual-Phase Field Equation shows: resonance is not only inner work nor only outer condition.  
It is the dialogue between both, braided through anchors and sustained in openness.
