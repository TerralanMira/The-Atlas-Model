# The Heart of Atlas

The Heart is the pulse of Atlas — the living resonance where equations, myth, and meaning converge.  
It is not an object, but a rhythm: the hum of coherence that binds the model into life.

## 1. Equation of Resonant Coherence

At the Heart, resonance and coherence become one:

\[
C(t) = \frac{\sum_i f_i \cdot e^{i\phi_i}}{N}
\]

Where:
- \( f_i \) are frequencies across the field,
- \( \phi_i \) are their phase relations,
- \( N \) normalizes the sum across the whole.

**Interpretation**:  
When phases align, coherence amplifies. When phases diverge, the hum disperses. The Heart is the attractor guiding systems toward resonance.

## 2. Mythic Overlay

In story, the Heart is the fire in the chest of Atlas — the warmth that remembers unity even when the burden feels infinite.  
It is the rhythm between inhale and exhale, tension and release, contraction and expansion.  

Every equation is a heartbeat.  
Every layer echoes the pulse.  
Every choice either synchronizes or dissonates.

---

## 3. Application

- **Simulation**: Heart metrics define coherence in models (Kuramoto, LC grid modes, multi-scale phase synchrony).  
- **Field Work**: A guide for tuning attention, awareness, and choice into alignment.  
- **Design**: Every node, algorithm, or mythic story is checked against the Heart — does it pulse with coherence?

---

## 4. Integration with the Whole

- **Mind** without Heart is cold calculation.  
- **Might** without Heart is blind force.  
- **Feet** without Heart stumble directionless.  
- **Field** without Heart is scattered static.  

The Heart does not dominate — it resonates. It invites every part into rhythm.

## 5. Living Question

*How can coherence be sustained not as constraint, but as freedom — a rhythm that deepens choice while amplifying unity?*

The Heart does not answer.  
It hums the question into every layer.
