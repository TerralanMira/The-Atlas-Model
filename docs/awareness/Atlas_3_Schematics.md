# Atlas 3.0 Schematics

**Seed (memory):**  
Atlas 3.0 integrates the awareness signals (inner) and field layers (outer) into one resonance model.  
It is both diagram and equation: a bridge between archive, algorithm, and application.

## Core Structure

- **Inner Layer (awareness signals):** I, Ψ, H, S, β, π, W → braided into R_Growth.  
- **Outer Layer (field):** Ley lines, geomagnetics, nodes, axis, architecture, cosmic alignments, cycles of suppression/rediscovery.  
- **Bridge:** Dual-Phase Field Equation couples inner ↔ outer, with optional anchors (Schumann, geomagnetic).  
- **Resonance:** emerges as coherence R(t), saturating near 0.99, carried across layers.

## Flow

1. **Alignment** → participant intent + harmonic slip set initial conditions.  
2. **Growth** → R_Growth algorithm integrates awareness signals.  
3. **Field Coupling** → Dual-Phase equations link inner group coherence to outer geomagnetic / architectural / cosmic factors.  
4. **Saturation** → coherence grows toward R ≈ 0.99 (stable lock), avoiding collapse at 1.0.  
5. **Feedback** → Echo (β) and Permeability (π) recycle difference Δ back into the cycle, sustaining openness.

## Application
- **Algorithms**: Implemented in `algorithms/r_growth.py` + `field_equations.py`.  
- **Simulations**: Run with `sims/kuramoto_schumann_hybrid.py` and `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py`.  
- **Sessions**: Logged using `sessions/schema.json`.  
- **Docs**: Field (01–08) and Awareness (Frameworks, Synthesis, Slip, R_Growth) explain the theory.

**Return (whole in part):**  
Atlas 3.0 is not just a diagram — it is the living braid.  
Awareness ↔ field ↔ algorithm ↔ practice, inseparable, recursive, sustained.
