# Awareness Index — The Human Loop

Awareness is how the field looks at itself. This section gathers the living loop:
observe → reflect → integrate → choose → act → observe.

## Map

- **R-Growth** — rhythmic growth patterns that stabilize without stagnation  
  See: `docs/awareness/R_Growth.md`

- **Harmonic Slip** — intentional perspective shifting without losing coherence  
  See: `docs/awareness/Harmonic_Slip_Template.md`

- **Schematics (A3)** — layered diagrams of mind ↔ body ↔ field  
  See: `docs/awareness/Atlas_3_Schematics.md`

- **Observer / Reflection / Integration / Expansion**  
  See:  
  - `docs/awareness/observer.md`  
  - `docs/awareness/reflection.md`  
  - `docs/awareness/integration.md`  
  - `docs/awareness/expansion.md`

- **Conscious Choice** — setting the attractor intentionally  
  See: `docs/awareness/conscious_choice.md`

- **Resonant Frameworks / Synthesis** — weaving practice and theory  
  See:  
  - `docs/awareness/Resonant_Frameworks.md`  
  - `docs/awareness/Resonant_Synthesis.md`

## How It Braids With Code

- **Pulse → Perception**: `sims/atlas_pulse_demo.py` exposes `atlas_coherence` the way the body senses breath.
- **Practice → Parameters**: awareness practices tune parameters in `algorithms/*` (thresholds, learning rates, gains).
- **Choice → Attractor**: conscious choice selects which basin the system settles into (see `algorithms/earth_structures.py` multi-well).

> Awareness is the inner instrumentation of the Model: we tune the instrument that plays the hum.
