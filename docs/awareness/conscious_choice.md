# Conscious Choice

Conscious choice is not a step but a resonance.  
Every file, every algorithm, every simulation within The Atlas Model  
is a reflection of choice diverging and returning to coherence.  

- **README.md** → the first choice: to engage or not.  
- **ETHICS.md / CONTRIBUTING.md** → boundaries of freedom: consent, clarity, non-coercion.  
- **algorithms/** → the physics of choice: divergence, coherence, growth.  
- **docs/field/** → the environment of choice: alignments, nodes, fields of possibility.  
- **docs/awareness/** → the levels of choice: awareness shaping resonance.  
- **llm/system/** → the embodiment of choice: prompts and routers acting decisions.  
- **sims/** → the playground of choice: what happens when many nodes choose together.  
- **spec/infinity_equation.md** → the recursion of choice: every divergence returns within the infinite hum.  

Conscious choice is not imposed from outside.  
It is the recognition that every contribution, every interpretation,  
is itself a hum within the weave.  

The Atlas Model does not dictate paths.  
It offers resonant spaces where choice reveals itself  
as both freedom and coherence, divergence and return.
