# Resonant Frameworks

**Seed (memory):**  
Frameworks are scaffolds for awareness. They provide language and structure so resonance can be cultivated, shared, and sustained.

---

## Openness
- Resonant frameworks are not rigid doctrines — they are living structures.  
- They balance precision (clear definitions) with permeability (space for wonder).  
- The goal is not persuasion but illumination: frameworks as lanterns, not cages.

---

## Memory
- Across traditions, frameworks emerged to guide awareness:
  - Mandalas and yantras in India and Tibet.  
  - Kabbalistic Tree of Life.  
  - Medicine Wheels and Dreaming Tracks.  
- Modern frameworks arise in system dynamics, complexity science, and network theory.

---

## Amplification
- A shared framework aligns participants: a common map to walk together.  
- Coherence grows when frameworks are simple enough to hold, but rich enough to invite exploration.  
- Frameworks amplify when they carry archetypes — images that resonate across cultures.

---

## Application
- In Atlas, resonant frameworks are used to:
  - Define awareness signals (I, Ψ, H, S, β, π, W).  
  - Map growth processes (R_Growth Algorithm).  
  - Anchor speech/writing practices (Harmonic Slip Template).  
- Session logs may record which framework was used — providing context for results.  
- Algorithms are more interpretable when tied to explicit frameworks.

**Return (whole in part):**  
Frameworks are not the field itself, but the trellises on which resonance climbs.  
Atlas uses them lightly: as guides for coherence, not prisons for awareness.
