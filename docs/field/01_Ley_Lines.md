# Field Layer 01 — Ley Lines

**Seed (memory):**  
Ley lines are the first map of resonance in landscape — invisible currents that ancient builders, shamans, and geomancers traced across continents. They are the skeleton of the field.

---

## Openness
- Ley lines are not “mystical wires” but resonance pathways where subtle forces converge.
- Measured as alignments between sacred sites, magnetic anomalies, and geologic features.
- They act as conductors of awareness: when humans gather at nodal points, coherence amplifies.

---

## Memory
- Ancient cultures built monuments along lines (stone circles, temples, cathedrals).
- Indigenous traditions recall “songlines” — stories walking the lines into being.
- Modern geomancy maps them as “energy grids” or “dragon lines.”

---

## Amplification
- Coherence increases at intersections (nodes).
- Buildings aligned to these currents resonate longer, sustaining awareness past the individual.
- Ley lines are not separate from human intent — intention activates and tunes them.

---

## Application
- In Atlas, ley lines provide the **outer frame** for resonance placement.
- Session logs may note **mode-antinode placement** relative to mapped lines.
- Algorithms (Dual-Phase, Soul-in-Field) are sensitive to the environmental “substrate” — this is that substrate.

**Return (whole in part):**  
Ley lines remind us: resonance does not float. It flows in the earth, in memory, in story.  
Atlas algorithms without ley lines are untethered; with them, they are grounded.
