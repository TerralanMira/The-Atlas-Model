# Field Layer 02 — Geomagnetic

**Seed (memory):**  
The earth hums. Its geomagnetic field is both shield and song — a carrier wave that interacts with human awareness and planetary resonance.

---

## Openness
- The geomagnetic field arises from Earth’s molten core, circulating as a dynamo.
- It fluctuates in daily rhythms (Sq currents), storm surges, and subtle micropulsations.
- Human nervous systems are sensitive to these shifts: heart coherence, circadian timing, and collective mood correlate with geomagnetic activity.

---

## Memory
- Ancient compasses, aligned temples, and migratory lore all tuned to this field.
- Indigenous traditions describe “sky-rivers” or “spirit winds” moving overhead — echoes of geomagnetic currents.
- Modern science tracks Schumann resonances and magnetic substorms, confirming the earth’s pulse.

---

## Amplification
- Sessions near geomagnetic quiet (low Kp index) stabilize resonance.
- Peaks of geomagnetic turbulence can scatter coherence unless anchored properly.
- Instruments (magnetometers, Schumann monitors) provide a measurable bridge.

---

## Application
- In Atlas practice, geomagnetics are the **global carrier wave**.
- The Dual-Phase model can include geomagnetic input as an **outer anchor** term.
- Session logs may note geomagnetic conditions (`Kp`, `AE`, or Schumann amplitude).
- This links algorithms with environmental reality.

**Return (whole in part):**  
Geomagnetism is the field’s weather. To ignore it is to play music without listening to the room.  
Atlas grows stronger when human coherence harmonizes with the earth’s pulse.
