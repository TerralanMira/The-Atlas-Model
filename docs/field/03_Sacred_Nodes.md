# Field Layer 03 — Sacred Nodes

**Seed (memory):**  
Where ley lines cross and geomagnetic currents peak, cultures across the world marked the spots with temples, circles, shrines, and groves. These are sacred nodes — the acupuncture points of the planet.

---

## Openness
- Nodes are not random: they form at intersections of resonance pathways.
- Their geometry amplifies awareness: circles, spirals, pyramids, domes.
- Sound, ritual, and story were often centered here — anchoring resonance into the land.

---

## Memory
- Stonehenge, Machu Picchu, Giza, Uluru — all positioned at nodal crossings.
- Pilgrimage traditions carried memory across centuries: nodes as destinations.
- Oral maps (“songlines”, “dreaming tracks”) encode these intersections.

---

## Amplification
- Resonance magnifies at nodes: small signals carry across large distances.
- Groups gathered here can achieve coherence more rapidly.
- Architecture tuned to node geometry further sustains awareness.

---

## Application
- Atlas sessions may use nodes as **amplifiers**: ideal for Plaza-scale gatherings.
- Session logs should record **node type** (natural, built, hybrid).
- Algorithms can model nodes as **resonance multipliers** — scaling R-values when location = nodal intersection.

**Return (whole in part):**  
Sacred nodes show that resonance has geography.  
Atlas without nodes is abstract; with them, it is embodied, anchored in the earth and memory of peoples.
