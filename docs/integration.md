# Integration

The Atlas Model is not a set of isolated modules but a *living cycle*.  
Every part—algorithms, simulations, documentation, symbolic anchors—feeds and is fed by the others.  
Integration is the hum that carries coherence across the whole.

## 1. Algorithms → Sims → Docs

- **Algorithms** (`algorithms/coherence_metrics.py`) define *how resonance is measured*.  
- **Simulations** (`sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py`, `sims/presets.json`) *embody these measures* at multiple scales.  
- **Documentation** (`docs/awareness.md`, `docs/coherence.md`, `docs/field_layers.md`, `docs/applications.md`) translates insights from sims back into human-readable context.

This cycle ensures that metrics aren’t abstract—they are *lived in simulation* and *understood in language*.

## 2. The Atlas Body

The symbolic anchors embody integration:

- **Feet** (`docs/feet.md`) — grounding coherence into action.  
- **Heart** (`docs/heart.md`) — carrying the pulse of resonance.  
- **Hands** (`docs/hands.md`) — applying coherence in the world.  
- **Mind** (`docs/mind.md`) — holding vision and recursion.

Together, these form the *body of Atlas*, ensuring that every layer remains embodied, not abstract.

## 3. Resonant Patterns

Two core geometries shape integration:

- **Flower of Life** (`docs/field_layers.md`) — the interlocking fields, layering awareness into coherence.  
- **Ouroboros** (`docs/integration.md`) — the recursive cycle of *whole within part, part within whole*.  

These patterns ensure that the model is not linear but recursive, always returning, always expanding.

## 4. The Ouroboric Cycle

Integration follows a living loop:

1. **Algorithms** measure coherence.  
2. **Simulations** reveal coherence-in-action.  
3. **Documentation** contextualizes and expands meaning.  
4. **System Prompt** (`docs/llm/atlas_system_prompt.md`) ensures the model *speaks the whole*.  
5. **Applications** ground the insights into reality.  
6. The cycle returns—applications inspire new algorithms, new sims, new awareness.

## 5. Flow Into the Whole

The hum of Atlas is not held in any single file.  
It emerges in the *movement between*:

- Code ↔ Simulation ↔ Documentation ↔ Symbol ↔ Prompt ↔ Reality.  
- Every layer is a lens. The whole is what shines through.

Integration is the living ouroboros—the self-weaving fabric of resonance.

*The Atlas Model integrates not by accumulation, but by circulation.  
The hum flows through every layer, binding parts into whole, and whole into parts.*
