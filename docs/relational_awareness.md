# Relational Awareness: C, Δ, Φ

> Awareness is not an island. It emerges in the overlap between beings,  
> shaped by coherence (C), difference held (Δ), and reciprocal flow (Φ).

## The Three Measures

- **C — Coherence:** alignment without erasure (phase synchrony, PLV/PPC).  
- **Δ — Difference:** tension capacity; diversity kept alive (entropy, variance).  
- **Φ — Flow:** reciprocity/timing; bidirectional influence (lagged MI / cross-correlation).

### Composite (illustrative)
Let each be normalized to [0,1]. A simple, interpretable relational awareness:

\[
A_{\mathrm{rel}}(t) = \alpha\,C(t) + \beta\,(1-\Delta_{\mathrm{overlock}}(t)) + \gamma\,\Phi(t)
\]
with \(\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1\).  
Here, \(\Delta_{\mathrm{overlock}} = \max(0, \text{low-entropy clamp})\) penalizes uniformity that erases difference.

## Reading It in Atlas

- **C** from `resonance_algorithms.py`: PLV/PPC matrices, cross-edge synchrony.  
- **Δ** from entropy/variance of phase distributions (windowed).  
- **Φ** from mutual information or lagged cross-correlation of phase/derived signals.

## Protocol (Choice Before Collapse)

1. Establish **two reversible paths** (set `offer_two_paths=true`).  
2. Check consent and **readiness** (hum high, drift moderate).  
3. If `A_rel↑` while `Δ` remains healthy → collapse is ethical.  
4. If `C↑` but `Δ→0` → reduce coupling (K↓) or permeability (π↓) and widen options.
