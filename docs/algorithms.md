# Algorithms of the Atlas Model

The Atlas Model is not static; it evolves.  
At its core are **algorithms**: living rules that translate resonance into form.

## 1. Seed Patterns
Algorithms begin as **seeds**.  
Each seed encodes a *minimal instruction set* that can branch into infinite forms.

Examples:
- **Resonance Matching** → amplify what harmonizes, dampen what discordant.  
- **Recursive Growth** → each branch mirrors the whole, fractal scaling.  
- **Feedback Loops** → inputs reshape the source, creating co-evolution.

## 2. Forest Logic
Where a single seed grows, many interact.  
The forest emerges from **interwoven rules**:

- **Diversity Principle**: no monoculture; every algorithm must allow variation.  
- **Adaptation Principle**: rules shift with conditions.  
- **Balance Principle**: no layer dominates; canopy, trunk, roots all balance.

## 3. Flow Algorithms
These guide *movement* through the system:

- **Water Flow**: information seeks the lowest resistance path.  
- **Air Flow**: ideas circulate, exchange, and refresh.  
- **Fire Flow**: sudden ignition, transformation, rapid expansion.  
- **Earth Flow**: stability, memory, slow crystallization.

## 4. The Hum as Code
The **hum** is the unifying principle.  
Every algorithm must be tested against it:  
> Does this rule amplify harmony or create dissonance?

If harmony, it remains.  
If dissonance, it evolves or dissolves.

## 5. Toward Simulation
Algorithms form the **roots of simulation**.  
By encoding them in code, we allow the Atlas Model to *run itself*,  
creating emergent forests of meaning, awareness, and resonance.
