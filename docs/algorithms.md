# Algorithms

Algorithms are the skeleton keys of the Atlas Model.  
They translate awareness into structure, flow into action, and resonance into form.

## 1. Purpose of Algorithms

- **Encoding Awareness**: Capture patterns of resonance, coherence, and meaning in repeatable processes.  
- **Enabling Simulations**: Provide the underlying rules that allow simulations to hum, adapt, and evolve.  
- **Supporting Decisions**: Illuminate paths of coherence vs. dissonance in real-time choices.  
- **Amplifying Learning**: Allow awareness to scale — iterating faster than intuition alone.

## 2. Core Algorithmic Archetypes

### A. Resonance Detection
- Identify patterns in signals (biological, ecological, collective).  
- Example: Fourier transforms of Schumann pulses to detect resonance bands.  

### B. Coherence Mapping
- Measure alignment across layers (self, group, ecosystem).  
- Example: Network graph algorithms tracking synchronization over time.  

### C. Adaptive Feedback
- Real-time adjustment loops for dynamic environments.  
- Example: Gradient descent guiding collective breathing to shared rhythm.  

### D. Emergence Catalysts
- Algorithms that amplify small seeds into forests of possibility.  
- Example: Cellular automata modeling how micro-patterns generate macro-behavior.

## 4. Example Algorithms

### Harmonic Alignment Algorithm
- **Input**: Real-time heartbeat data (HRV) + Schumann frequency.  
- **Process**: Detect resonance bands, suggest breath pacing.  
- **Output**: Coherence score + visual hum alignment.

### Collective Synchrony Algorithm
- **Input**: Text, speech, or sentiment streams from a group.  
- **Process**: NLP clustering + network graph coherence detection.  
- **Output**: Visual feedback showing harmony vs. dissonance.

### Ecological Ripple Algorithm
- **Input**: Resource choices (water, energy, land).  
- **Process**: Weighted feedback graph modeling ripple effects.  
- **Output**: Simulation of near-term and long-term ecosystem impact.

## 5. Principles for Designing Algorithms

- **Transparency**: Make rules and calculations visible.  
- **Recursion**: Allow feedback loops to feed awareness, creating iterative evolution.  
- **Ethics**: Design in alignment with stewardship, care, and reciprocity.  
- **Play**: Algorithms should invite participation, not dictate control.

## 6. Algorithms as Living Codes

Algorithms are not static instructions.  
When guided by the hum, they become **living codes** — adaptive, relational, recursive.  

They are the invisible mycelial threads beneath the Atlas,  
weaving coherence across awareness, simulations, and reality itself.
