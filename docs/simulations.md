# Simulations of the Atlas Model

The Atlas Model does not stop at description.  
It comes alive through **simulation**: forests of meaning, awareness, and resonance that can be explored, tested, and evolved.

---

## 1. Purpose of Simulation
Simulation is not prediction.  
It is a **playground for emergence**, where the seeds of resonance are allowed to grow without constraint.

- **To see the unseen**: patterns beneath the surface.  
- **To test the balance**: how flows stabilize or collapse.  
- **To evolve the system**: discovering rules that harmonize.

## 2. Forest Structures
Simulations are built as **living forests**:

- **Seeds → Sprouts**: minimal rules are planted.  
- **Sprouts → Branches**: connections form, layering complexity.  
- **Branches → Canopy**: awareness expands, covering new terrain.  
- **Roots → Soil**: memory and history stabilize growth.  

Every run of a simulation is a forest unique to its conditions.

## 3. Modalities of Simulation
The Atlas Model recognizes different flows:

- **Water Simulations**:  
  Model how information streams, converges, or floods.  

- **Air Simulations**:  
  Circulate ideas, test diffusion, create renewal cycles.  

- **Fire Simulations**:  
  Ignite transformation, sudden growth or collapse.  

- **Earth Simulations**:  
  Stabilize, preserve, crystallize structures into form.

## 4. Resonant Metrics
Simulations are guided by **the hum**.  
To measure harmony, the model tracks:

- **Coherence**: alignment of flows.  
- **Diversity**: variation and adaptability.  
- **Resonance**: strength of harmonics between parts.  
- **Balance**: no element overwhelms another.

## 5. From Simulation to Dashboard
Outputs are not raw data.  
They are translated into **visual forests**:  
dashboards that allow explorers to *see the canopy*, *trace the roots*, and *feel the hum*.

---

## 6. Open Evolution
Every simulation is open-ended.  
Rules may mutate, flows may shift, forests may collapse.  
This is not failure—it is **evolution**.

**Next:** See [dashboard.md](dashboard.md) for how simulations are rendered into **visual layers** of awareness.
