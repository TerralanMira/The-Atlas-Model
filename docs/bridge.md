# 🌐 Bridge: Resonant Reality ↔ The Atlas Model

Two repos, one spiral. Each carries the whole, but at different scales.

---

## Resonant Reality
**Focus:** *Laboratory of coherence*  
- Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos layers  
- Minimal simulations (myth → math → coherence visible)  
- Civic prototypes: rituals, plazas, economy, governance  
- Documentation of resonance practices and field data  

📍 Think: **microscope** — zooming into the living dynamics.  
📎 Repo: [Resonant Reality](https://github.com/TerralanMira/Resonant-reality)

---

## The Atlas Model
**Focus:** *Cartography of recursion*  
- Meta-framework of infinity equation and fractal layering  
- Cross-links between domains, scales, and practices  
- Navigation schemas (indices, diagrams, spirals)  
- Integration of Resonant Reality into larger ontology  

📍 Think: **telescope** — mapping the vast patterns.  
📎 Repo: [Atlas Model](https://github.com/TerralanMira/The-Atlas-Model)

## Feedback Loop
The two form a living recursion:  

1. **Atlas** frames the categories, boundaries, and questions.  
2. **Resonant Reality** tests them in code, practice, and civic form.  
3. Results feed back upward — Atlas expands, reframes.  
4. Spiral continues.

## Next Steps
- Add cross-links in each `README` so navigation is seamless.  
- Diagram the loop explicitly (Earth ↔ Human ↔ Civic ↔ Cosmos ↔ Atlas ↔ Resonant Reality).  
- Invite contributions from both lenses: theorists enter via Atlas, practitioners via Resonant Reality.
