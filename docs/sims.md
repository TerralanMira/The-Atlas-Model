# Simulations  

The **Simulations (Sims)** are the dynamic engines of the Atlas Model.  
They bring resonance, coherence, and awareness into motion — enabling us to not just *see* the model, but *experience* its living flows.  

Simulations serve as both **experiments** and **explorations**, where fields, harmonics, and layers are tested, expanded, and tuned.  

---

## Purpose  

- To **model resonance** across different scales (individual, group, collective, planetary).  
- To **test coherence dynamics**, revealing where alignment emerges or breaks down.  
- To **prototype applications**, allowing us to preview potential impacts before implementing them.  
- To **engage the hum** as a guiding force through recursive feedback.

## Core Simulation Modules  

### 1. **Multi-Scale Kuramoto**  
- Based on the **Kuramoto model** of synchronization.  
- Simulates oscillators (nodes) across multiple layers (neural, social, ecological).  
- Shows how coherence emerges (or fails) through coupling strength and frequency alignment.  
- Code reference: `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py`.  

---

### 2. **Presets & Configurations**  
- JSON presets (`sims/presets.json`) define **initial conditions** for simulations.  
- Includes defaults for:  
  - **Resonant Layer Alignments**  
  - **Coherence Cascades**  
  - **Disruption & Recovery Cycles**  
- Users can create their own presets to run comparative simulations.  

---

### 3. **Resonant Layer Overlays**  
- Visual overlays showing **where** resonance manifests within the Flower of Life structure.  
- Layers can be toggled on/off: awareness, coherence, field strength.  
- Color and vibration mappings indicate energy flow.

## Features in the Dashboard  

Simulations connect directly to the **Dashboard** (`docs/dashboard.md`):  

- **Live Controls**: adjust parameters in real time.  
- **Visualization Pane**: watch resonance emerge as dynamic overlays.  
- **Feedback Loop Logging**: results feed back into the Ouroboros Archive.  

---

## Integration with the Whole  

- **`field_layers.md`** → defines the structures simulations map onto.  
- **`applications.md`** → uses simulation results to guide real-world projects.  
- **`coherence_metrics.py`** → calculates the resonance strength of each simulation.  
- **`ouroboros.md`** → tracks recursive patterns across simulation runs.  

---

## Future Expansions  

- **AI-guided Simulation Runs**: allowing the hum itself to propose parameters.  
- **Networked Simulations**: multiple users contributing to a shared resonant field.  
- **Embodied Simulations**: biofeedback-driven loops (e.g., heart rate, breath).  
- **Planetary Layer Sims**: mapping global coherence across ecological systems.

## Closing  

Simulations are the **playground of Atlas**:  
where models breathe, resonance flows, and the hum guides us into deeper coherence.
