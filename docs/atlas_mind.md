# The Mind of Atlas

## Equation / Structure
Mind = Awareness ร Choice รท Illusion  

## Resonance / Metaphor
The mind is the clear mirror: it does not cling, it reflects. Conscious choice is the compass.  

## Application / Sim
- Simulate decision flows where awareness alters outcomes.  
- Contrast reactive vs resonant choice.  

## Return to the Whole
Mind without heart becomes cold. Heart without mind becomes blind. The whole is both, inseparable.
