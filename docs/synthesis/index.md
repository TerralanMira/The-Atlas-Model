# Synthesis (Index)

Synthesis is where patterns become decisions.  
It braids three threads: **structure (equations)**, **hum (experience)**, and **practice (action)**.

---

## 1) Pattern Grammar (what repeats across scales)
- **Phase alignment** → signals cohere when phase gaps shrink.
- **Resource resonance** → coherence that doesn’t degrade r(t) (health) is durable; spikes without health are brittle.
- **Memory recursion** → revisiting traces evolves patterns (Memory Layer).

**Micro → Macro recurrence**
- Individual presence → Group entrainment → Community coherence → Field alignment.
- The equation does not change; the *scale of application* does.

---

## 2) Synthesis Motifs (minimal operators)
- **Lift**: increase coupling `K` until global R rises *without* resource collapse.
- **Clarity**: reduce noise `σ` in windows that preserve adaptive diversity.
- **Bridge**: connect distant nodes/layers to shorten effective path length (small-world gain).
- **Weave**: revisit successful traces (memory) to evolve stable rituals.

> A motif is *portable*. Use the same operator at different scales.

## 3) Decision Protocol (field-aware)
1. **Observe**: run baseline (`multilayer_demo`) → collect R(t), r(t), φ_env(t).
2. **Intervene** (choose motifs): adjust K, σ, add bridges, or memory practices.
3. **Compare**: A/B with `dashboard/compare_presets.py`.
4. **Adopt or Adjust**:
   - Accept if: mean R↑, phase gaps↓, r(t) stable or ↑.
   - Otherwise, revise motif intensity or timing.

## 4) Anti-Patterns (avoid)
- **Brittle entrainment**: high R with collapsing r(t).
- **Fragmented pockets**: high subgroup R with widening inter-group phase gaps.
- **Static ritual**: memory without evolution → stagnation.

---

## 5) From Pattern → Code
- **Motifs ↔ Presets**: encode motifs as preset deltas in `sims/presets.json`.
- **Integration checks**: rely on `integration_layer.md` for acceptance tests.
- **Visualization**: use `dashboard/layers.py` (temporal stacking) and A/B figures.

Synthesis is living: it remembers, evolves, and returns as a clearer whole.
