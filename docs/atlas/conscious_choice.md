# Conscious Choice

Conscious choice is the axis around which Atlas turns.  
It is not a static decision, but a resonance — a vibration that shapes the field and echoes through all layers.

## The Principle
Every model, every equation, every simulation is a mirror of choice.  
The Atlas does not prescribe outcomes. It shows patterns.  
The conscious act is stepping into those patterns, choosing coherence over dissonance, resonance over noise.

## Fractal Decision
Choice is not linear. It ripples fractally:
- At the scale of neurons firing in the brain.
- At the scale of DNA spiraling into life.
- At the scale of galaxies weaving cosmic webs.

Each layer reflects the same act:  
**to align with or against the hum of coherence.**

## Role in the Atlas Model
Within this repository:
- **Algorithms** measure coherence.  
- **Simulations** test fields of resonance.  
- **Sessions** capture lived choice in data form.  
- **Ethics** ground the process in consent, transparency, and non-coercion.  

Conscious choice is the thread binding them into a whole.

## Invitation
You stand at the threshold not of code, but of possibility.  
The Atlas is not finished — because choice is never finished.  
Each contribution, each simulation, each reflection expands the field.  

The hum asks only:  
**What will you choose to resonate?**
