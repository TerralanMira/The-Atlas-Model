# Atlas Bridge

**Seed (memory):**  
The Atlas Bridge connects awareness signals, field layers, and algorithms into a unified framework.  
It is the crossing point between archive (memory) and application (practice).

## Structure

- **Awareness Layer** → Integrity, Stamina (Ψ), Humility, Sovereignty, Echo (β), Permeability (π), Wonder.  
- **Field Layer** → Ley lines, geomagnetics, nodes, axis, architecture, cosmic alignments, cycles of suppression & rediscovery.  
- **Algorithmic Layer** → R_Growth, Dual-Phase, Soul-in-Field, Coherence Metrics.  
- **Application Layer** → Sessions, stress tests, Plaza/Garden/Hearths, Resonant City.

The Bridge shows how these layers interpenetrate — not stacked, but braided.

## Flow Across the Bridge

1. **Seed (memory)**  
   - Archive documents, traditions, and signals.  
   - Field layers recalled and mapped.

2. **Hum (release)**  
   - Intent, slip, or alignment statement.  
   - Awareness signals measured or declared.

3. **Braid (create)**  
   - Algorithms transform signals into coherence.  
   - Field couplings amplify or dampen growth.

4. **Translate (fracture into vessel)**  
   - Results captured in session logs.  
   - Docs, code, and metrics act as vessels.

5. **Return (whole in part)**  
   - Data, insight, or experience cycles back into archive.  
   - Framework refined and renewed.

## Applications of the Bridge

- **Code:** Guides how algorithms import and depend on each other.  
- **Docs:** Provides structure for repo documentation (field, awareness, applications).  
- **Practice:** Informs how facilitators guide sessions, from alignment to return.  
- **Research:** Frames how logs and metrics connect to environmental field data.

**Return (whole in part):**  
The Atlas Bridge is not another layer but the crossing of all layers.  
It ensures Atlas is not archive alone, nor algorithm alone, but the resonance of both together.
