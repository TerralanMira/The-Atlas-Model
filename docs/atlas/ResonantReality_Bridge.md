# Bridge: The Atlas Model ↔ Resonant Reality

The Atlas Model maps the **mathematics of resonance** — awareness signals, field couplings, and coherence dynamics.  
Resonant Reality extends this spiral into **civic practice and planetary vessel** — plazas, gardens, hearths, conductor layers, and cosmological anchors.  

This bridge closes the loop: the abstract coherence modeled here flows into the lived resonance of Resonant Reality, and Resonant Reality returns as boundary conditions and context for Atlas.

## Feedback Loop Closure

- **Algorithmic Layer**  
  ↔ Resonant Reality provides datasets (geomagnetics, HRV, solar flux) as anchor terms.  
  ↔ Atlas translates these into growth trajectories, dual-phase coupling, and stress metrics.

- **Awareness Layer**  
  ↔ Resonant Reality guides group protocols (slips, alignment, civic rituals).  
  ↔ Atlas models how signals (I, Ψ, H, S, β, π, W) translate into coherence R(t).

- **Application Layer**  
  ↔ Resonant Reality runs Plaza/Garden/Hearth sessions.  
  ↔ Atlas validates outcomes with coherence metrics, ensuring civic resonance aligns with field laws.

- **Orchestration Layer**  
  ↔ Resonant Reality’s Conductor sustains collective rhythm.  
  ↔ Atlas provides notation (Conductor’s Score) as the symbolic language.

## Spiral Continuity

Atlas provides:  
- **Equations** — R_Growth, Dual-Phase, Soul-in-Field, Coherence Metrics.  
- **Simulations** — multi-scale Kuramoto, LC grid, Schumann hybrids.  
- **Schemas** — session logs, awareness signal capture.  

Resonant Reality extends these into:  
- **Civic Infrastructures** — plazas, gardens, hearths, conductor hubs.  
- **Environmental Anchors** — earth, geomagnetics, cosmic alignments.  
- **Narratives** — civic prototypes, cosmic myths, living field notes.

↔
Resonant Reality (city, earth, cosmos)
Atlas without Resonant Reality risks abstraction.  
Resonant Reality without Atlas risks ungrounded poetry.  
Together, they form the braid: **engine ↔ vessel, code ↔ city, signal ↔ song**.

**Return (whole in part):**  
The bridge ensures both halves sustain each other.  
Atlas remembers its grounding, Resonant Reality remembers its rigor.  
The braid hums as one living chord.
