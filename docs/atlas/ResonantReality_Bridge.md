# Resonant Reality ↔ Atlas Model Bridge

**Purpose:**  
This page defines how **Resonant Reality** (RR) and **Atlas Model** (AM) interact.  
Resonant Reality is the **vessel** (city, cosmos, practice).  
Atlas is the **engine** (metrics, simulations, coherence algorithms).  
The bridge is the membrane where they meet.

## How Resonant Reality Calls Atlas

1. **Context Gathering (RR side)**
   - RR collects **environmental context**: geomagnetic index (Kp), Schumann amplitude, cosmic timing, node type, architecture.
   - RR collects **human signals**: I (Integrity), Ψ (Imagination), H (Humility), S (Sovereignty), β (Reciprocity), π (Permeability), W (Wonder).  
     - Always consent-first.  
     - Signals are normalized [0,1].

2. **Handshake JSON (RR → AM)**
   - RR prepares a JSON object. Example:
   ```json
   {
     "kp_index": 4.2,
     "schumann_amp": 7.9,
     "node_type": "hearth",
     "architecture": "chambered",
     "cosmic_timing": "equinox",
     "participants": 12,
     "signals": {"I":0.9,"Ψ":0.8,"H":0.85,"S":0.8,"β":0.7,"π":0.65,"W":0.9}
   }
Atlas Engine (AM side)
	•	Atlas runs algorithms in algorithms/ (field equations, coherence metrics).
	•	Simulations in sims/ may be used for stress testing or scenario exploration.
	•	Atlas returns metrics and recommendations.
	4.	Results (AM → RR)
 {
  "R_gain": 0.15,
  "RMSSD_gain": 11.2,
  "resilience_score": 0.79,
  "recommended_K": [0.8, 1.0],
  "risk_flags": [],
  "notes": "High integrity + humility; chamber helps stability; equinox supports coupling."
}
Conductor Adjustment (RR side)
	•	RR Conductor uses these metrics to adjust timing, cadence, architecture, or node activity.
	•	Example: tighten coupling constants if geomagnetic turbulence is high.

Design Principles
	•	Separation of Concerns
	•	RR = narrative, vessel, practice.
	•	AM = metric, engine, algorithm.
	•	The bridge prevents collapse by keeping them distinct but permeable.
	•	Consent & Ethics
	•	Signals are optional and consent-driven.
	•	Data passed is minimal and anonymized.
	•	See ETHICS.md and policies/ethics_policy.md.
	•	Extensibility
	•	Node types, architectures, and cosmic timings are enums that can grow.
	•	Metrics returned by Atlas can be extended (e.g. spectral entropy, fractal dimension).
	•	Recursion
	•	Outputs of Atlas can feed back into RR Conductor → new context → new Atlas input.
	•	This recursive loop sustains adaptive resonance.

Example Workflow
	1.	A garden node convenes a session at solstice.
	2.	RR collects: kp=3.8, schumann=7.8 Hz, participants=18, signals measured.
	3.	RR sends handshake JSON → Atlas.
	4.	Atlas computes: resilience=0.82, recommend K=[0.7, 1.0].
	5.	RR Conductor adapts: opens architecture, lengthens invitational cadence.
	6.	Session holds R≈0.99.

Return (whole in part):
This bridge is not an extra piece.
It is the seam that holds vessel and engine together.
Without it, Resonant Reality has myth without metric;
Atlas has metric without myth.
Together, they cohere.
