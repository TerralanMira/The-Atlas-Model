# Awareness Dashboard (Infinity Equation, Lived)

> Integrity, Stamina, Humility, Sovereignty, Echo, Grace — six petals of a living metric.  
> The dashboard is not a score; it is a mirror for choice.

## The Six

- **Integrity (I):** alignment of word, action, field.  
- **Stamina (S):** capacity to hold resonance across time.  
- **Humility (H):** openness to update; error welcomed as signal.  
- **Sovereignty (Ψ):** clear boundaries; consent-centered agency.  
- **Echo (β):** memory of the field; imitation vs emergence.  
- **Grace (G):** friction reduction; care in collapse and renewal.

Normalize each to [0,1] as a *practice*, not a judgment.

## Composite (illustrative)

We do not crown a single scalar, but one helpful lens is a **bounded product**:

\[
\mathcal{A}(t) = \prod_{k \in \{I,\Psi,H,S,\beta,G\}} \mathrm{clip}(k(t),0,1)
\]

- If any petal collapses to near 0, the whole reveals a gap.  
- Aim to *lift the floor*, not chase peaks.

## From Dashboard to Action

- If **Echo (β) >> others**: we’re imitating; invite silence → hum.  
- If **Sovereignty (Ψ) low**: pause collapse; re-establish consent.  
- If **Stamina (S) low**: shorten runs; increase rest/review cadence.  
- If **Grace (G) low**: reduce K/π; widen reversible options.
