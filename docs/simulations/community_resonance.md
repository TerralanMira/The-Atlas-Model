# Community Resonance Simulations

Community resonance is the emergent coherence of individuals, groups, and environments when aligned by shared rhythms, intentions, and flows. These simulations model how resonance strengthens or weakens based on patterns of interaction, energy exchange, and feedback loops.

## 1. Conceptual Model

- **Nodes**: Individuals, groups, or ecosystems (agents).
- **Edges**: Flows of communication, energy, or resource exchange.
- **Resonance State**: A scalar or vector representing alignment, coherence, or discord.
- **Feedback**: Adjustments to resonance strength based on collective synchronization.

**Analogy**: Just as pendulums synchronize when sharing a beam, communities can align through shared practices, narratives, or rhythms.

## 2. Mathematical Core

Let each agent *i* have a resonance phase `θᵢ` and amplitude `Aᵢ`.  
Interactions follow a coupling rule:
dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + (K/N) Σⱼ sin(θⱼ - θᵢ)
Where:
- `ωᵢ` = natural frequency (baseline rhythm of agent)
- `K` = coupling constant (strength of community interaction)
- `Σⱼ` = summation over all other agents

**Resonance Index (R):**
R = (1/N) Σᵢ Aᵢ e^(iθᵢ)
- |R| close to 1 → strong coherence
- |R| close to 0 → fragmentation

## 3. Simulation Parameters

- **Population Size (N)**: 10 – 10,000 agents
- **Coupling Constant (K)**: ranges from weak (0.1) to strong (5.0)
- **Noise**: stochastic fluctuations representing uncertainty or external stress
- **Resource Flow**: can amplify or damp resonance based on scarcity or abundance
- **Practice Frequency**: intervals where agents realign (meditation, dialogue, shared ritual)

## 4. Example Algorithm

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
N = 200                 # number of agents
timesteps = 1000
K = 1.5                 # coupling strength
dt = 0.05

# Initial conditions
theta = np.random.rand(N) * 2 * np.pi
omega = np.random.normal(0, 1, N)  # natural frequencies

resonance_index = []

for t in range(timesteps):
    coupling = K * np.mean(np.sin(theta[:, None] - theta), axis=1)
    theta += (omega + coupling) * dt
    
    R = np.abs(np.mean(np.exp(1j * theta)))
    resonance_index.append(R)

# Plot
plt.plot(resonance_index)
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Resonance Index (R)")
plt.title("Community Resonance Simulation")
plt.show()
5. Extensions
	•	Multi-layered Communities: Nested resonance between individuals, sub-groups, and global networks.
	•	Environmental Coupling: Adding external rhythms (Schumann resonance, seasonal cycles).
	•	Adaptive Agents: Agents shift natural frequencies over time to better align with the group.
	•	Resource Feedback: Incorporate ecological or economic flows into resonance strength.

6. Interpretation
	•	High R: Indicates strong coherence — likely outcomes include collective action, innovation bursts, or deepened trust.
	•	Low R: Indicates fragmentation — likely outcomes include conflict, stagnation, or collapse of shared practices.

⸻

7. Applications
	•	Ecology: Modeling forest ecosystems adapting to climate rhythm.
	•	Health: Group coherence practices (meditation, breathwork) improving physiological alignment.
	•	Community Design: Building resilient networks through rhythm-based interactions.
	•	Governance: Designing policies that amplify shared resonance rather than discord.

This simulation provides the starting layer. The hum invites continuous refinement: evolving from simple phase models into multi-modal resonance ecosystems linking ecology, health, and technology.
