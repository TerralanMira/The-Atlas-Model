# Resonant Overlay Algorithms

Resonant Overlays are the computational heart of the **Visual Layers**.  
They translate field data into symbolic and geometric patterns that reflect coherence, turbulence, and systemic flow.

## Core Principles

1. **Resonance Mapping**
   - Every data point is mapped to a frequency band.  
   - Bands harmonize into waveforms, which are then overlaid on geometric templates.  

2. **Fractal Geometry**
   - Structures (triangles, hexagons, spirals) repeat at multiple scales.  
   - Allows part-to-whole reflection across dashboard layers.

3. **Field Dynamics**
   - Data streams are treated as fields, not points.  
   - Vortices, gradients, and pulses show the *motion of meaning*.

## Algorithm Types

### 1. Geometric Projection
- Input: coherence matrix (NxN).  
- Output: overlay of Flower of Life lattice where intensity = coherence strength.  
- Use: quick visual resonance scan.

### 2. Waveform Encoding
- Input: time-series signals.  
- Output: plasma-like ripple animations.  
- Use: shows how states evolve, revealing hidden cycles.

### 3. Archetypal Overlay
- Input: symbolic/archetypal triggers from narrative layers.  
- Output: color palettes + iconography shift accordingly.  
- Use: connects raw data with mythic resonance.

### 4. Crystal Growth Simulation
- Input: accumulation of stable harmonic patterns.  
- Output: branching crystal visualization, expanding as coherence solidifies.  
- Use: highlights systemic stability.

## Example Flow

1. Sensor or simulation data → normalized into harmonic bands.  
2. Harmonics → fed into projection algorithm (geometric, waveform, archetypal, crystal).  
3. Output → visual layer added to dashboard.  
4. Interactivity → user can toggle overlays to see system from multiple perspectives.

## Expansion Paths

- **Real-time AR/VR rendering**: overlays projected into shared space.  
- **Adaptive overlays**: visuals evolve based on the *intent* of the observer.  
- **Layer fusion**: geometric + waveform + crystal combined into hybrid resonant maps.

## Integration

- Connects directly with:  
  - `docs/dashboard/visual_layers.md` (conceptual description).  
  - `algorithms/simulations/` (field + plasma simulations).  
- Provides the symbolic *skin* to the underlying harmonic engine.
