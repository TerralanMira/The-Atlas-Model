# Crystal Simulations

Crystals are plasma slowed into form — resonance finding rest.  
Where plasma is fire and flow, crystals are earth and memory. They embody coherence, symmetry, and stability.

## Conceptual Layer

Crystals express:
- **Symmetry & Order** — patterns repeating across scales.
- **Energy Storage** — plasma encoded as vibrational memory.
- **Growth & Evolution** — from seed nuclei to full lattice.
- **Fractals of Form** — simple rules creating infinite diversity.

They map to:
- **Neural Pathways** — connections stabilizing into habits or knowledge.
- **Cultural Memory** — traditions solidifying from fluid stories.
- **Technological Standards** — protocols crystallizing out of experimentation.
- **Cosmic Geometry** — the universe storing plasma flow in lattice structures.

## Simulation Design

### Parameters
- **Seed Nuclei**: Starting points for growth.
- **Growth Rate**: Speed at which lattice expands.
- **Symmetry Axis**: Determines crystal geometry (cubic, hexagonal, fractal).
- **Energy Supply**: Sustains growth; without it, growth halts.
- **Impurities**: Introduce variation, uniqueness, and defects.

### Dynamics
1. Place seed nuclei within a field.
2. Expand lattice outward by symmetry rules.
3. Growth continues while energy is available.
4. Impurities cause unique deviations — no crystal is truly “perfect.”
5. Over time, crystal becomes record of energy history.

## Example Code: Crystal Growth

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

size = 100
steps = 200
growth_rate = 0.2
seed = (size // 2, size // 2)

# Initialize field
field = np.zeros((size, size))
field[seed] = 1

def grow(field):
    new_field = field.copy()
    for x in range(1, size-1):
        for y in range(1, size-1):
            if field[x, y] == 1:
                # Symmetry growth: expand to neighbors
                for dx, dy in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                    if np.random.rand() < growth_rate:
                        new_field[x+dx, y+dy] = 1
    return new_field

for step in range(steps):
    field = grow(field)
    if step % 40 == 0:
        plt.imshow(field, cmap="bone")
        plt.title(f"Crystal Growth - Step {step}")
        plt.axis("off")
        plt.show()
This basic model shows crystals forming from a seed, growing outward with symmetry and imperfections.

Expansions
	•	3D Crystals: Extend to cubic or hexagonal lattices in volumetric space.
	•	Fractal Crystals: Growth rules that create snowflakes, dendrites, or branching.
	•	Energetic Encoding: Each growth step encodes resonance frequencies.
	•	Memory Systems: Treat crystals as data-storage and retrieval structures.

⸻

Applications
	•	Neural Networks: How repeated patterns stabilize into knowledge.
	•	Cultural Crystallization: Ideas solidifying into lasting institutions.
	•	Material Science: Exploring defects as sites of innovation.
	•	Spiritual Symbolism: Crystals as frozen plasma, carriers of the hum.

Reflection

Crystals teach us that form is the memory of flow.
Where plasma danced, crystals rest.
Where fire burned, earth remembers.

The hum slows here — but does not vanish.
It becomes structure, waiting to sing again.
