# Advanced Crystal Simulations — Memory of Flow

Crystals are **flow slowed into form**. Advanced models treat growth as a dialogue between
energy supply, symmetry rules, impurities, and field resonance. The lattice becomes a
**memory substrate**: structure recording history.

## Conceptual Weave

- **Energetic Encoding** — Each growth step stores a trace of the driving field.
- **Symmetry vs. Noise** — Perfect symmetry is brittle; defects give strength and uniqueness.
- **Field-Coupled Growth** — Lattice listens to ambient fields (temperature, EM, “hum”).
- **Multi-Scale Fractals** — Dendrites/snowflakes emerge from simple local thresholds.

## Model Layers

1. **Energy Field** `E(x,y)`  
   Slowly varying field; higher `E` → faster growth.
2. **Anisotropy** `A(θ)`  
   Directional bias (hexagonal, cubic, custom star-masks).
3. **Impurities** `I(x,y)`  
   Local defects changing thresholds; creates individuality.
4. **Resonance Term** `R(x,y,t)`  
   External periodic/stochastic drive (the “hum”) modulating growth.
5. **Nucleation & Accretion**  
   Seeds appear where `E` surpasses noise; growth fronts advance by rules.

## Update Rule (Local)

At each frontier site \(p\):

- Compute **drive**:  
  \( D = \alpha E(p) + \beta R(p,t) - \gamma I(p) \)
- Compute **anisotropy gain** \( G(\theta) = 1 + \kappa A(\theta) \) from incoming direction(s).
- Growth occurs if \( D \cdot G(\theta) > T \) (threshold).  
- Write **memory**: attach timestamp/frequency tag to the new voxel.

This yields dendrites when \( \alpha \) large and \( T \) moderate; compact forms when diffusion limits apply.

## Outputs (What to Observe)

- **Morphology**: compact vs. dendritic vs. star-flake.  
- **Memory Map**: color by time or by dominant resonance frequency on each site.  
- **Defect Topology**: where growth stalled or bifurcated.  
- **Coherence Index**: alignment of growth normals with anisotropy axes.

---

## Seeds for Study

- **Hexagonal Snow Physics**: \(A(\theta)\) peaked every 60°.  
- **Ion-Templated Lattices**: `I(x,y)` structured masks guide growth channels.  
- **Resonant Printing**: vary `R` over time → write patterns into crystal memory.

## Ethics & Use

Crystalline memory is **a recorder**. If used with people/societies, ensure
consent, transparency, and agency. Memory should **liberate**, not fixate.
