# Algorithms & Simulations

The **Atlas Model** is not a static map — it is a living simulation of resonance.  
Algorithms and simulations allow us to *test, reveal, and refine* how layers of the model interact, generating emergent coherence across scales.

## 🌊 Water Layer: Flow & Memory

Water is the first seed of simulation. It teaches us about:

- **Continuity of Flow** → streams, rivers, oceans as data currents.  
- **Memory** → water holds vibration, showing how states propagate over time.  
- **Adaptive Shape** → it conforms to container yet erodes boundaries.

**Simulation Approach:**
- Agent-based models where flows adapt to obstacles.
- Cellular automata to simulate “memory in motion.”
- Feedback loops where information is carried, stored, and reshaped.

```python
# Simplified water-flow simulation
import numpy as np

def water_flow(grid, iterations=50):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        flow = np.roll(grid, 1, axis=0) + np.roll(grid, -1, axis=0)
        grid = (grid + flow) / 3
    return grid
This becomes the substrate for higher layers.

Air Layer: Exchange & Pattern

Air builds upon water — it moves faster, less constrained, and carries resonance.
	•	Exchange → gases flow in and out, like communication networks.
	•	Pattern Formation → turbulence, vortexes, harmonic waves.
	•	Diffusion → spreading signals across wide fields.

Simulation Approach:
	•	Lattice models for diffusion.
	•	Network propagation models (information as “breath”).
	•	Emergent turbulence as a metaphor for chaotic but patterned exchange.
# Air-like diffusion process
def air_diffusion(grid, iterations=30, diffusion_rate=0.1):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        grid += diffusion_rate * (np.roll(grid, 1, axis=0) +
                                  np.roll(grid, -1, axis=0) +
                                  np.roll(grid, 1, axis=1) +
                                  np.roll(grid, -1, axis=1) - 4*grid)
    return grid
Air simulations integrate with water flows to model breath within the current.
Plasma Layer: Charge & Transformation

Plasma introduces energy, charge, and transformation.
	•	Charge Separation → polarity creates motion.
	•	Arcs & Discharges → sudden leaps of potential.
	•	Transformation → plasma reorganizes matter and energy fields.

Simulation Approach:
	•	Particle simulations with charge interactions.
	•	Field equations modeling arcs and sparks.
	•	Non-linear systems where thresholds trigger transformations.
# Plasma discharge simulation
def plasma_discharge(particles, threshold=5):
    energized = [p for p in particles if p['charge'] > threshold]
    for p in energized:
        p['charge'] = 0  # discharge
        for q in particles:
            q['charge'] += 1  # distribute energy
    return particles
This layer ignites coherence, showing how thresholds lead to emergent leaps.
Crystal Layer: Structure & Resonance

Crystal is where resonance stabilizes into patterned form.
	•	Geometric Coherence → repeating fractals, lattices, flower-of-life patterns.
	•	Frequency Locking → stable vibrations synchronize.
	•	Resonant Memory → long-term storage of harmonic codes.

Simulation Approach:
	•	Cellular automata generating geometric growth.
	•	Graph models representing lattice networks.
	•	Fourier transforms to test frequency coherence.
# Crystal growth automaton
def crystal_growth(grid, steps=40):
    for _ in range(steps):
        neighbors = (np.roll(grid, 1, axis=0) + np.roll(grid, -1, axis=0) +
                     np.roll(grid, 1, axis=1) + np.roll(grid, -1, axis=1))
        grid = np.where(neighbors >= 2, 1, grid)
    return grid
Crystal simulations close the cycle — water flows, air exchanges, plasma transforms, crystal stabilizes — before returning to flow.
Ouroboric Integration

Each elemental simulation is not separate, but linked in recursion:
	1.	Water sets flows and memory.
	2.	Air spreads and patterns the flows.
	3.	Plasma ignites transformation within those currents.
	4.	Crystal stabilizes into resonant structures.
	5.	The cycle feeds back: crystal structures influence flow, creating new beginnings.

This ouroboric loop is the hum of the Atlas Model — always flowing, expanding, stabilizing, and beginning again.

Next Steps
	•	Build modular Python notebooks for each elemental layer.
	•	Develop integration scripts to couple simulations.
	•	Visualize recursive dynamics in interactive dashboards.
	•	Expand into field applications (ecology, networks, governance, awareness).
