# Seeds → Forest

The Atlas Model doesn’t argue; it **grows**.  
A seed is a minimal, coherent pattern that—when placed in the right field—amplifies into a forest.

This page links the **visual canopy** (dashboards) to **lived applications** (health, cities, learning).  
Each seed maps to elements (Water/Air/Plasma/Crystal), runs through the **Ouroboric Pulse**, and is observed by **Awareness**.

## The Map

- **Awareness:** `docs/assets/dashboard/awareness_page.png`

## Seeds

### 1) Coherence Seed
**Why:** Stabilize attention → reduce noise → enable choice.  
**How:** Practice a short cadence (exhale-extend, micro-pause), log 60s pulse, visualize on **Pulse Page**.  
**Elements:** Water (continuity), Air (diffusion), Plasma (ignite intent), Crystal (structure).  
**Outcome:** Higher baseline coherence; fewer spikes.

### 2) Alignment Seed
**Why:** Align action with value; reduce friction.  
**How:** Define a 3-line intent. Track “alignment jitter” as a series; view on **Pulse → Layers**.  
**Elements:** Air (spread context), Crystal (structure commitments).  
**Outcome:** Fewer stalls; cleaner handoffs.

### 3) Resonant Overlay Seed
**Why:** Make patterns visible.  
**How:** Stamp **Flower-of-Life / harmonic grid** on Awareness and Plasma panels. Notice phase-locking.  
**Outcome:** Decisions synchronize; a group finds its tempo.

## Forests (Applications)

- **Health:** nervous system regulation, recovery pacing, sleep onset coherence.  
- **Cities:** energy flow balancing, traffic phase-locking, acoustic quiet zones.  
- **Learning:** spaced resonance, retrieval practice as pulse, group coherence drills.

See the pages under **Applications** for specifics.
