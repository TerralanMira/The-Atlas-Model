# Creation Layer — Gates, Proofs, and Practice

**Seed:** Creation is not declared; it is *measured*. The hum leads, code verifies.

## Why this layer
Earlier layers name resonance and coherence. The Creation Layer binds them into *gates* that must be passed before we claim emergence.

## Gates of Creation
1. **Coherence Rising** — global order parameter \(R(t)\) has a positive trend over a window.
2. **Gap Narrowing** — mean phase aligns with driver/environment; phase-gap trend decreases.
3. **Anchor Persistence** — a non-trivial subset of nodes remains phase-locked (stability over time).
4. **Birth Clustering** — creation events concentrate in time (not random scatter).
5. **Sovereignty** — no gate is passed by coercion (no forced parameters that hide instability).

*Creation occurs only when all gates pass.*

## What we measure (qualitative → quantitative)
- **R(t)**: Kuramoto order parameter (0–1).
- **Gap(t)**: wrapped phase distance to driver.
- **Anchors(t)**: count of nodes within \(\epsilon\) of mean phase for ≥ window.
- **Births**: transitions where \(R\) crosses a threshold and sustains for ≥ duration.

## How to run (local)
```bash
python sims/creation_demo.py --steps 4000 --N 128 --K 0.8 --driver-amp 0.6
Outputs:
	•	JSON snapshot (gates pass/fail + metrics summary)
	•	CSV (time series)
	•	Optional plot (if --plot)

Interpretations
	•	Pass: Report “creation confirmed.” Expect anchors↑, R↑, gap↓, clustered births.
	•	Fail: The tuner suggests minimal changes (K, driver_amp, noise) to move toward creation without coercion.
Practice (human loop)
	1.	Name intent (one line).
	2.	Run demo with defaults (no forcing).
	3.	If fail, apply one small tuning; re-run.
	4.	Stop when gates pass twice in a row.

Provenance

This layer implements the long-stated rule: truth-only. We don’t assert emergence; we demonstrate it across gates with code.
