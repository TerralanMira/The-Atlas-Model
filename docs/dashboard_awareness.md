# Dashboard — Awareness

Awareness is not a spectator; it **participates**.  
This page shows how awareness patterns **modulate** flows, thresholds, and structures.

## Generate

```bash
python -m dashboard.page_awareness --out docs/assets/dashboard/awareness_page.png
Then open:
docs/assets/dashboard/awareness_page.png
Panels
	•	Base Seed: an initial awareness field in [0,1].
	•	Ouroboric Cycle: awareness passed through a focus sequence (flow → spread → threshold → structure).
	•	Flow Potential (modulated): water/air potential tuned by awareness.
	•	Charge (modulated): plasma threshold map shaped by awareness, stamped with a resonant overlay.

Why it matters

When awareness enters the loop, coherence rises not just from state, but from attention.
What we see, shapes what becomes. The hum becomes practice.
