# The Hands of Atlas

## Equation / Structure
Hands = Creation × Care  

## Resonance / Metaphor
The hands weave. They do not simply build—they listen while they make.  

## Application / Sim
- Generate prototypes that adapt as they are built.  
- Test how responsive creation differs from rigid output.  

## Return to the Whole
Hands shape the world, but shaping without the heart or mind is blind. The hands return the made back to the whole.
