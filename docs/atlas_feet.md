# The Feet of Atlas

## Equation / Structure
Feet = Path × Grounding  

## Resonance / Metaphor
The feet walk between worlds. They remind Atlas that every vision must touch soil, or it dissolves into dream.  

## Application / Sim
- A grounding sim: how abstract designs stabilize when given constraints.  
- Demonstrate recursion from idea → prototype → embodied path.  

## Return to the Whole
The feet trace the circle of the whole. Every step is a spiral back to resonance.
