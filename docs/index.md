# # The Atlas Model

**Seed (memory):**  
The Atlas Model is a **coherence engine**.  
It measures, simulates, and stabilizes resonance across scales — human, civic, planetary.  

It does not replace the vessel. That is the role of **Resonant Reality**.  
Instead, Atlas provides the **metrics, algorithms, and conductor tools** that let the vessel know when it is in tune, and how to sustain near-lock (**R ≈ 0.99**) without collapse.

## What Atlas Is

- **Engine:** algorithms (`algorithms/`), metrics (`coherence_metrics.py`), simulations (`sims/`).
- **Awareness:** signals (I, Ψ, H, S, β, π, W) and frameworks that map practice into numbers.
- **Applications:** dual-phase field, soul-in-field, stress tests.
- **Conductor Tools:** optional LLM layer (`llm/`) for role-shifting and ethical gating.
- **Bridge:** a handshake (`docs/atlas/bridge_handshake.md`) that connects Atlas to Resonant Reality.

---

## What Atlas Is Not

- Not a city, ritual, or cosmology. Those belong to **Resonant Reality**.
- Not coercive. All logging is consent-first (`sessions/schema.json`, `ETHICS.md`).
- Not closed. Atlas is designed as a **permeable membrane** — extensible, improvable, recursive.

## How to Use

1. **Run the algorithms**  
   - Example: `python examples/session_to_metrics.py --in sample.json --plot`  
   - Produces coherence metrics and coupling recommendations.

2. **Simulate dual-phase fields**  
   - Example: `python examples/dual_phase_with_anchor.py --kp 4.2 --anchor`  
   - Explore how geomagnetic drivers (Kp) and anchors affect coherence.

3. **Apply awareness frameworks**  
   - Use `docs/awareness/signals_guide.md` to rate signals (0–1).  
   - Feed these into session logs → metrics.

4. **Bridge to Resonant Reality**  
   - RR gathers context → sends JSON → Atlas returns metrics.  
   - See `docs/atlas/bridge_handshake.md`.

## The Bridge

Atlas exists in relationship.  
To understand the full vessel and story, see **[Resonant Reality → docs/core/atlas_model.md](https://github.com/terralanmira/resonant-reality)**.  
To connect Atlas technically, start with **[ResonantReality_Bridge.md](atlas/ResonantReality_Bridge.md)**.

**Return (whole in part):**  
Atlas is not the whole song.  
It is the tuning fork, the conductor’s ear, the math of resonance.  
The song itself — the vessel, the field, the city, the cosmos — lives in Resonant Reality.  
Together they form one chord.
