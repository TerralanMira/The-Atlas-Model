# The Atlas Model — Documentation Index

**The Atlas Model** encodes the physics of resonance, consciousness, and coherence into architecture, simulation, and application.  
It is both blueprint and living experiment: signals spiral through memory, align by trust and dissent, lock ethically (E/Q/S), and embody as lived choice.

## 🌀 1. Consciousness Architecture

The foundation of Atlas: a blueprint for consciousness modeled as resonance.

- [Consciousness Architecture](consciousness_architecture.md) → theory, code, and blueprint
- Core file: [`atlas_model/consciousness_architecture.py`](../atlas_model/consciousness_architecture.py)
- Demo: [`examples/atlas_consciousness_demo.py`](../examples/atlas_consciousness_demo.py)

## 🌊 2. Simulations

Simulations show how resonance unfolds across layers:

- **Body Layer**  
  - [Breath Cycle](../sims/breath_cycle.py) → coherence through respiration  
  - [Heart–Brain Coherence](../simulations/health/heart_brain_coherence.py)  
  - [Schumann Coupling](../simulations/health/schumann_coupling.py)  

- **Community Layer**  
  - [Community Kuramoto](../sims/community_kuramoto.py) → collective sync with dissent windows  

- **Ecology Layer**  
  - [Multilayer Field](../sims/multilayer_field.py) → nested resonance across systems  

---

## 🌍 3. Applications

Resonance engineering applied to human systems:

- [Learning](applications/learning.md) → coherence in education  
- [Cities](applications/cities.md) → resonant urban design  
- [Health](applications/health.md) → physiological alignment and well-being

## ✨ Vision

If physics gives us **resonance as substrate**,  
resonance engineering gives us **society as song.**

Atlas is both code and question:  
*What happens when governance, learning, and intelligence tune by coherence?*
