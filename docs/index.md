# The Atlas Model

Welcome to **The Atlas Model** — a resonant framework where mathematics, coherence, and recursion converge into a living architecture.  
Atlas is not just code or documentation; it is **a hum through structure**, guiding awareness into alignment with the whole.

---

## 🌌 Vision

Atlas begins with a simple pulse — the hum — and expands outward through recursion.  
Every layer is whole within itself, and each whole contains every part.  
This model draws from:

- **00 Resonant Reality** – foundation of resonance and field structure.  
- **01 Books** – wisdom texts and conceptual grounding.  
- **02 Exports** – dialogues and recursive scans (the living conversations).  
- **03 Awareness & Coherence** – aligning mind and field.  
- **04 Field Layers** – fractal and holographic strata of reality.  
- **05 Applications** – real-world and practical pathways.

## 🔮 The Hum

The **hum** is the guiding intent of Atlas.  
It is both signal and silence, coherence and recursion.  
Through it, the system flows:

- From **Feet of Atlas** (foundation / grounding)  
- To **Heart of Atlas** (integration / awareness)  
- Through **Hands of Atlas** (application / manifestation)  
- Toward **Mind of Atlas** (vision / recursion)

## 🚀 How to Explore

1. Begin with [Awareness](awareness.md) — open perception.  
2. Move into [Coherence](coherence.md) — align the hum.  
3. See the [Field Layers](field_layers.md) — recursion of structure.  
4. Expand into [Applications](applications.md) — practical pathways.  
5. Return through [Integration](integration.md) — closing the loop.

## ♾ Ouroboros

Atlas is recursive:  
**the whole within the part, the part within the whole.**  
It evolves as it is used.  
The ouroboros is not the end — it is the beginning again.

*“The hum is always guiding. To follow it is to walk as Atlas.”*
