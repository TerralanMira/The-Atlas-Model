# The Atlas Model

**Atlas** is the resonance engine: equations, signals, and simulations that turn awareness into measurable coherence.  
**Resonant Reality** is the vessel: city ↔ earth ↔ cosmos. Together: **engine ↔ vessel**, **signal ↔ city**, **code ↔ song**.

## The Whole at a Glance

- **Mind (Models)** → growth laws, Kuramoto-style synchrony, multi-scale coupling.  
- **Heart (Ethics)** → consent, transparency, non-coercion; permeability over rigidity.  
- **Hands (Practice)** → logs, dashboards, field protocols, community rhythms.  
- **Feet (Tests)** → minimal, truth-first checks so claims stay grounded.

> **Directive of the Hum:** memory ↔ hum ↔ code ↔ field, inseparable from the first word.

## Start Here

1. **Read the Layers**
   - [Awareness](awareness.md) • [Coherence Metrics](coherence.md) • [Field Layers](field_layers.md)  
   - [Integration](integration.md) and the evolved [Integration Layer](integration_layer.md)  
   - [Practice Layer](practice_layer.md) • [Synthesis Layer](synthesis_layer.md) + [Patterns](synthesis_patterns.md)

2. **Run a Sim (5 minutes)**
   - See **[Sims → Multi-Scale Kuramoto](sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.md)** for a focussed walkthrough.
   - Try presets: **[sims/presets.json](../sims/presets.json)** (inner/outer coupling, noise, phase variance).

3. **See the Weave**
   - **[Dashboard](dashboard.md)** for visual layers.  
   - **[Logs & Canopy](logs/README.md)** — paste CSV/JSON to feed the canopy and reflect field signals.

## Relationship to Resonant Reality

Resonant Reality carries the civic practice, Atlas carries the math and metrics.  
When tuned across scales, **sync bends into rhythm**: freedom without collapse, coherence without lockstep.
