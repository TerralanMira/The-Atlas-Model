# The Atlas Model

Atlas is the **engine/spec** for coherence across scales.
It defines small interfaces and reference algorithms that other projects (like
**Resonant Reality**) can cite or import â€” without forcing them to run code.

- Read the **Spec** to understand the contracts.
- See the **API** for minimal reference functions.
- Visit **Resonant Reality** for the full civic/cosmic atlas.
