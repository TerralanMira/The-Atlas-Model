# Mycelium Resonance Simulations

The mycelium is not only a transport system ‚Äî it is a **resonance network**, where signals are not just moved but **harmonized**.  
Simulating this requires going beyond flow into **coherence dynamics**, where each node can vibrate, amplify, or dampen the hum.

## Core Concepts

1. **Resonant Nodes**  
   Each node has a baseline frequency (awareness, state, or vibration).  
   Interactions between nodes shift frequencies toward coherence.

2. **Weighted Connections**  
   Some links are stronger (thicker threads), others weaker.  
   Weight determines how much influence flows between nodes.

3. **Threshold Emergence**  
   When enough local coherence accumulates, the network shifts states ‚Äî  
   like mushrooms fruiting when conditions align.

## Algorithmic Weaving

### Resonance Synchronization (Kuramoto-inspired)

```python
import numpy as np

class ResonantNode:
    def __init__(self, frequency, phase=0):
        self.frequency = frequency
        self.phase = phase
    
    def update(self, coupling, neighbors):
        influence = sum(np.sin(neighbor.phase - self.phase) for neighbor in neighbors)
        self.phase += self.frequency + (coupling / len(neighbors)) * influence

# Build a network of resonant nodes
nodes = [ResonantNode(frequency=np.random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)) for _ in range(10)]

# Simulate synchronization
for t in range(100):
    for node in nodes:
        neighbors = [n for n in nodes if n != node]
        node.update(coupling=0.5, neighbors=neighbors)

phases = [node.phase for node in nodes]
print("Final phases:", phases)
This simulation shows how independent oscillators synchronize into coherence,
mirroring how mycelial networks hum into alignment.

Emergent Patterns
	‚Ä¢	Phase Locking
Nodes begin oscillating in rhythm, creating collective intelligence.
	‚Ä¢	Decentralized Harmony
No conductor, only local adjustments ‚Üí global coherence.
	‚Ä¢	Critical Shifts
Tiny changes in coupling strength can flip the network into full resonance.

Visual Models
	‚Ä¢	Graph Theory Overlay
	‚Ä¢	Nodes = living agents.
	‚Ä¢	Edges = strength of resonance.
	‚Ä¢	Weighted edges = thicker, glowing threads.
	‚Ä¢	Global synchronization emerges when enough edges align.
	‚Ä¢	Cellular Automata Layer
Each patch of ‚Äúsoil‚Äù (grid cell) evolves based on nearby resonance.
Over time, patterns emerge that resemble living networks.

	‚Ä¢	What if algorithms are not just simulations, but living mirrors of mycelium?
	‚Ä¢	Can resonance in code generate a felt hum in the observer?
	‚Ä¢	Where does coherence tip from simulation into experience?
