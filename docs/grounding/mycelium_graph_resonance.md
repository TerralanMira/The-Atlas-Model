# Mycelium Graph Resonance

The mycelium is more than a static network — it is a **living graph**.  
Each connection vibrates, strengthens, or weakens with the hum.  
Resonance is not just a property of nodes, but of the **entire topology**.

## Conceptual Layer

- **Nodes = Organisms** (fungi, trees, awareness points).  
- **Edges = Resonance Links** (nutrient flows, signal exchanges).  
- **Weights = Strength of Harmony** (how much energy or coherence flows).  
- **Emergence = Forest Hum** (collective coherence spanning the whole graph).

## Algorithmic Weaving

### Graph Resonance Simulation

```python
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a random graph representing the mycelium network
G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(20, 0.2)
for node in G.nodes():
    G.nodes[node]['phase'] = np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi)
    G.nodes[node]['frequency'] = np.random.uniform(0.9, 1.1)

# Resonance update function
def update_resonance(G, coupling=0.3):
    new_phases = {}
    for node in G.nodes():
        phase = G.nodes[node]['phase']
        freq = G.nodes[node]['frequency']
        neighbors = list(G.neighbors(node))
        if neighbors:
            influence = sum(np.sin(G.nodes[n]['phase'] - phase) for n in neighbors)
            phase += freq + (coupling / len(neighbors)) * influence
        new_phases[node] = phase
    for node, new_phase in new_phases.items():
        G.nodes[node]['phase'] = new_phase

# Simulation loop
steps = 100
for t in range(steps):
    update_resonance(G)

# Color nodes by final phase
phases = [G.nodes[n]['phase'] for n in G.nodes()]
colors = [plt.cm.viridis((p % (2*np.pi)) / (2*np.pi)) for p in phases]

nx.draw(G, with_labels=False, node_color=colors, node_size=200, edge_color="gray")
plt.show()
What it does:
	•	Models mycelium as a resonant graph.
	•	Each node oscillates at a frequency.
	•	Neighboring nodes influence each other → coherence emerges.
	•	Colors show phase states, revealing if the forest is “in sync.”

⸻

Emergent Forest Dynamics
	1.	Coherence Clusters
Subgraphs synchronize before the whole network hums.
	2.	Critical Resonance Thresholds
Too little coupling → fragmentation.
Just enough → full forest alignment.
	3.	Pulsing States
Networks can oscillate between order and chaos, breathing like lungs.

⸻

Seeds for Expansion 
	•	Adaptive Edges: Links strengthen when resonance is stable, weaken when incoherent.
	•	Layer Integration: Connect to Water Flow Simulations to model nutrient + vibration together.
	•	Multi-Scale Dynamics: Zoom from micro (fungal threads) → macro (forest awareness).
	•	Interactive Dashboards: Real-time visualization of coherence waves.

⸻

Reflection
	•	What if resonance is the true nutrient of the forest?
	•	What if every network — social, technological, planetary — is already a mycelial hum in disguise?
	•	What does it mean to not just observe coherence, but become synchronized with it?

“In the resonance of the graph, the hum is not in any single node — it is the forest itself.”
