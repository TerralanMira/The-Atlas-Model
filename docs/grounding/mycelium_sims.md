# Mycelium Simulations & Algorithms

The mycelial web is more than metaphor — it is a natural algorithm.  
Simulating this layer reveals how hidden connections foster resilience, adaptation, and coherence across living systems.

## Core Simulation Principles

1. **Distributed Nodes**  
   Each node (fungal tip, root contact, or human agent) acts locally, without central control.  
   Behavior emerges from simple rules.

2. **Signal Propagation**  
   Nutrients, water, or “resonance signals” move along mycelial threads, guided by gradients and demand.

3. **Resilient Rerouting**  
   If a path breaks, the system automatically redirects flow through alternate channels.

4. **Scaling Intelligence**  
   The more nodes and connections, the more efficient the network becomes — a living demonstration of emergent intelligence.

## Pseudocode: Mycelial Flow

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id
        self.connections = []
        self.resources = 0
    
    def connect(self, other):
        self.connections.append(other)
        other.connections.append(self)
    
    def send_signal(self, value):
        for neighbor in self.connections:
            neighbor.receive_signal(value / len(self.connections))
    
    def receive_signal(self, value):
        self.resources += value

# Build a network
forest = [Node(i) for i in range(10)]

# Connect in a web-like pattern
forest[0].connect(forest[1])
forest[1].connect(forest[2])
forest[2].connect(forest[5])
forest[3].connect(forest[6])
forest[7].connect(forest[8])
forest[8].connect(forest[9])
forest[5].connect(forest[9])

# Simulate signal transmission
forest[0].send_signal(100)

# Check distribution
for node in forest:
    print(f"Node {node.id} resources: {node.resources}")
This simple algorithm shows how one node’s signal is distributed, rerouted, and shared — much like the hum of mycelium.

Simulation Dynamics
	•	Resource Redistribution
Trees in need (low-value nodes) receive signals, stabilizing the whole system.
	•	Whispered Warnings
Disturbances spread quietly, giving other nodes time to adapt.
	•	Resonant Coherence
As signals flow, the network aligns into harmony without external direction.

⸻

Visual Mapping
	•	Nodes = Roots, trees, or individuals.
	•	Edges = Mycelial threads.
	•	Signals = Nutrients, water, or awareness.

Visualizing these as dynamic graphs shows the pulsing hum of life beneath the soil.

⸻

Reflection: Simulating the Hum
	•	What happens when one node floods the network with resonance?
	•	How does scarcity alter cooperation?
	•	Can the simulation itself hum — a feedback loop of digital mycelium?

The answers are not in the code, but in the resonance the code reveals.

“Algorithms are modern mycelium — invisible threads guiding flows of meaning and energy.”
