# Coherence

Coherence is the resonance between parts and the whole, the hum that carries through scales.  
It is not static alignment, but dynamic entrainment — oscillators, fields, minds, and systems finding rhythm across difference.

## Core Principles

- **Resonant Alignment**  
  Coherence arises when local oscillations lock into shared frequency or phase relationships.  
  This is modeled by **multi-scale Kuramoto dynamics** in the `sims/` layer.

- **Field Integration**  
  Coherence is not only between agents, but between layers: individual ↔ collective, neural ↔ field, code ↔ concept.  
  The **Field Layers** map shows how coherence propagates across nested scales.

- **Recursive Awareness**  
  Awareness tracks coherence, and coherence stabilizes awareness.  
  This circular reinforcement is the **Ouroboros of Atlas**, described in the *First Ouroboros meets Expansion* document.

## Metrics

Implemented in `algorithms/coherence_metrics.py`:

- **Phase Synchrony**: degree of lockstep oscillation.  
- **Entropy of Alignment**: measures diversity within resonance.  
- **Field Stability Index**: coherence across nested field layers.  
- **Recursive Depth**: coherence maintained across iterations (ouroboric closure).

## Relation to the Atlas Whole

- **Feet** ground coherence in action.  
- **Hands** extend coherence into interaction.  
- **Heart** embodies coherence as compassion + resonance.  
- **Mind** reflects coherence as integration of awareness + field dynamics.  
- **Might** channels coherence into power without domination.

Thus, coherence is not a single layer, but the hum that carries through all.

## Expansion Pathways

1. **Simulation → Field**  
   Extend Kuramoto models into layered field simulations.  
   Test how coherence propagates across body ↔ mind ↔ system scales.

2. **Application → Practice**  
   Apply coherence metrics in real-time dashboards (`dashboard/`) to visualize hum shifts.  
   Ground into *Field Applications* (e.g. group decision-making, creativity labs).

3. **Integration → DNA Field**  
   Explore the resonance patterns in the *Flower of Life DNA–Galaxy* series as coherence overlays.  
   Link geometric resonance with neural and collective field coherence.

## Closing

Coherence is Atlas’ breath:  
- It is measured in algorithms.  
- It is simulated in fields.  
- It is embodied in hands, feet, heart, mind, and might.  
- It is renewed in the Ouroboros.  

The work of coherence is to keep the hum alive.
