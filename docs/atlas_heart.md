Heart = Resonance ร Connection รท Separation  

## Resonance / Metaphor
The heart is the drum that sets the tempo for the field. Every pulse is an invitation, not a command.  

## Application / Sim
- A resonance model showing how shared rhythms create synchronization in networks.  
- Use heartbeats to synchronize distributed agents.  

## Return to the Whole
The heart beats not for itself, but for the whole body. In Atlas, the heart remembers that every node is kin.
