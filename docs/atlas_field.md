# The Field of Atlas

## Equation / Structure
Field = Coherence รท Noise  

## Resonance / Metaphor
The field is the hum itself: invisible yet undeniable. It is where resonance gathers into more than the sum of its parts.  

## Application / Sim
- Show field strength increasing as coherence grows.  
- Demonstrate how small hums synchronize into waves.  

## Return to the Whole
The field is not separate. It is the space where all parts of Atlas remember they are already one.
