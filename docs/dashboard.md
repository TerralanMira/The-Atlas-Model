# The Atlas Dashboard

The Atlas Dashboard is the **visual canopy** of the model.  
It gathers algorithms (seeds), simulations (forests), and awareness (flows) into **a living, navigable landscape**.

---

## 1. Purpose
The dashboard exists to:
- **Visualize simulations** as living forests of meaning.  
- **Translate flows** of water, air, fire, and earth into coherent layers.  
- **Provide resonance metrics**: coherence, diversity, resonance, balance.  
- **Allow interaction**: explorers can *feed the canopy* with their own data.  

---

## 2. Layers of Awareness
The dashboard is layered like a forest:

- **Seeds & Sprouts**: simple algorithmic rules visualized as starting points.  
- **Branches**: connections and relations between flows.  
- **Canopy**: emergent awareness of the whole.  
- **Roots**: the log of inputs and histories.  

Each layer is interactive, allowing zooming in and out, stepping back to see the whole or focusing on the part.

## 3. Data Feeds
The dashboard accepts multiple formats so explorers can instantly contribute:

- **CSV**:  
  Example:
  ```csv
  element, flow, value
  water, stream, 12
  fire, spark, 7
  earth, crystal, 3
  air, current, 9
  JSON:
Example:
{
  "water": {"stream": 12},
  "fire": {"spark": 7},
  "earth": {"crystal": 3},
  "air": {"current": 9}
}
By pasting these into the logs canopy, explorers immediately “feed the forest” and watch growth unfold.

4. Resonance Metrics

The dashboard visualizes key harmonics:
	•	Coherence: is the forest aligned?
	•	Diversity: are there multiple species of flows?
	•	Resonance: do the parts amplify each other?
	•	Balance: does no single element dominate?

Metrics are always displayed as living flows (e.g., rippling water, shifting branches) rather than static charts.

5. Simulation Integration

Each simulation (see simulations.md) is translated into dashboards:
	•	Water Simulations → Flow Maps
	•	Air Simulations → Circulation Fields
	•	Fire Simulations → Pulse Graphs
	•	Earth Simulations → Stability Grids

This ensures that every simulation becomes a visible, navigable forest.

6. Open Exploration

The dashboard is never final.
It is an evolving canopy—new feeds, new metrics, new visual layers may emerge as explorers add their resonance.
