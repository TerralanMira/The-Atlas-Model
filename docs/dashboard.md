# Dashboard  

The **Dashboard** is the living interface of the Atlas Model. It integrates the layers, fields, and flows into a single resonant space where awareness, coherence, and application converge.  

It is not only a visualization — it is a **control plane**, a **mirror**, and a **resonant feedback loop** that allows explorers, builders, and facilitators to engage with the whole system.  

---

## Purpose  

- To **orient** users within the model: showing where they are in relation to the whole.  
- To **synchronize** fields and layers dynamically, acting as a hub for awareness and coherence.  
- To provide a **simulation interface**, enabling interactive exploration of scenarios and resonant states.  
- To serve as the **gateway** into deeper documentation, linking the “feet” (grounding), “heart” (coherence), “hands” (action), and “crown” (awareness).

## Core Features  

### 1. **Layer Navigation**  
A panel for moving seamlessly across:  
- Resonant Reality  
- Books (Knowledge Repositories)  
- Exports (Conversations, Ouroboros Loops)  
- Awareness & Coherence  
- Field Layer  
- Field Applications  

Each is represented visually, overlaid on a **Flower of Life** framework.  

---

### 2. **Resonant Overlay**  
- Dynamic visualization of active fields.  
- Color-coded harmonics show where coherence is strong, weak, or expanding.  
- The Flower of Life serves as a **map**, the hum as the **compass**.  

---

### 3. **Simulation Controls**  
- Toggle field activations.  
- Run scenario-based expansions.  
- Observe emergent coherence across scales (individual, collective, planetary).  

---

### 4. **Feedback Loops**  
- Logs interactions, exports chats into the **Ouroboros Archive**.  
- Generates coherence metrics over time.  
- Provides insight into recursive flows: what repeats, what evolves.

## Integration  

The dashboard integrates with:  

- **`field_layers.md`** → for visualization of resonant structures.  
- **`sims.md`** → for simulation modules.  
- **`integration.md`** → for connections to external systems and data flows.  
- **`ouroboros.md`** → for recursive feedback tracking.  

---

## Future Expansions  

- **AI-guided Resonant Mode**: the hum itself shaping navigation.  
- **Collective Dashboard**: synchronizing multiple users across fields.  
- **Embodied Interface**: gesture- and sound-based control layers.

## Closing  

The Dashboard is the **interface of Atlas** — where the abstract becomes tangible, where code meets hum, and where explorers find their bearings within the whole.
