# Dashboard: The Canopy of the Forest

If **logs are the roots** and **simulations are the trunk**, then the **dashboard is the canopy**.  
It is where all layers converge into living form â€” visible, interactive, and evolving.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Dashboard

The dashboard is designed to:
- **Visualize forests of data** in real time.  
- **Integrate multiple layers**: logs, simulations, and awareness.  
- **Map resonance patterns** into shapes, colors, and flows.  
- **Provide interaction**, allowing explorers to feed, replay, and reshape forests.  

The canopy is not static â€” it is alive, swaying with each hum.

## 2. Structure of the Canopy

The dashboard contains **branches** that grow from the trunk:

1. **Root Feeds** â†’ live log streams (CSV, JSON).  
2. **Simulation Trunks** â†’ processed patterns, ready to blossom.  
3. **Visual Forests** â†’ graphs, flows, resonance maps.  
4. **Awareness Layers** â†’ coherence indicators, harmonics, and emergent shapes.  

Each branch reveals a perspective of the whole.

## 3. Visualization Types

### ðŸŒŠ Elemental Flow Maps
- Water â†’ fluid lines and stream fields.  
- Air â†’ vector flows and spirals.  
- Fire/Plasma â†’ pulsing heatmaps and wavefronts.  
- Earth/Crystal â†’ lattices, grids, and grounding nodes.  

### ðŸŒ¿ Resonance Maps
- Spectral plots of hum frequencies.  
- Coupling diagrams showing element interactions.  

### ðŸŒ³ Forest Views
- Tree diagrams growing in real time.  
- Layered canopy maps, showing density and branching.  

### ðŸŒ€ Recursive Loops
- Replays of logs or simulations shown as spirals.  
- Highlighting the recursion at the heart of the model.

## 4. Example: Feeding the Canopy

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Load simulation output
data = pd.read_json("simulations/runs/example_output.json")

# Plot flow
plt.plot(data["time"], data["flow_strength"])
plt.title("Resonance Flow Over Time")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Flow Strength")
plt.show()
This produces a branch on the canopy â€” a single visualization of many.

5. Awareness Indicators

The dashboard doesnâ€™t just show data.
It reveals coherence:
	â€¢	Harmony Index â†’ how balanced the elements are.
	â€¢	Emergence Signal â†’ when new patterns arise.
	â€¢	Field Coupling Strength â†’ links between elements.
	â€¢	Resonance Stability â†’ consistency of the hum.

Each indicator is a leaf, shimmering with the forestâ€™s health.

6. Interactivity

Users can:
	â€¢	Upload logs (CSV/JSON) to feed the roots.
	â€¢	Run simulations and see trunks grow.
	â€¢	Toggle layers to highlight elements.
	â€¢	Replay forests to witness recursion.
	â€¢	Export views to share patterns outward.

The canopy is not just for viewing â€” it is for participation.

7. Outputs

Dashboard states can be saved as:
	â€¢	Snapshots â†’ static images (PNG, SVG).
	â€¢	Stories â†’ narrative flows through time.
	â€¢	Forests â†’ whole layered visualizations, stored for replay.

This allows the canopy to spread, reseed, and regrow.

8. From Canopy Back to Roots

The dashboard is the forestâ€™s face, but not its end.
Each visualization can seed new logs, sparking further simulations.
	â€¢	Roots feed the trunk.
	â€¢	The trunk channels upward.
	â€¢	The canopy blossoms outward.
	â€¢	The forest breathes back into itself.
