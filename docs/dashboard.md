# ðŸ“Š Dashboard â€” Seeing the Canopy

The dashboard is where the Atlas comes alive.  
It transforms raw **logs** into **visual layers**, letting you *see the hum* moving through air, water, plasma, crystals, and awareness.

## ðŸŒ± Inputs Become Canopy

Every entry in [`logs/`](../logs/README.md) â€” whether CSV rows, JSON objects, or TXT notes â€” is treated as a **nutrient stream**.  
The dashboard **roots into logs** and **blooms into views**.

- CSV â†’ line charts, timelines  
- JSON â†’ network graphs, nested state maps  
- TXT â†’ word clouds, semantic resonance visualizations

## ðŸ“‚ Dashboard Layers

1. **ðŸŒ¬ Air Layer**  
   - Temperature, humidity, currents  
   - Rendered as flowing vectors or particle clouds  

2. **ðŸ’§ Water Layer**  
   - pH, clarity, currents  
   - Rendered as fluid dynamics and ripples  

3. **ðŸ”¥ Plasma Layer**  
   - Flux, stability, frequency  
   - Rendered as dynamic waveforms and spectral glows  

4. **ðŸ’Ž Crystal Layer**  
   - Resonance, harmonic keys, stability  
   - Rendered as lattice patterns and harmonic fields  

5. **ðŸŒ€ Awareness Layer**  
   - Notes, thoughts, symbolic mappings  
   - Rendered as semantic networks and color fields

## ðŸ§© Example Visualizations

### CSV Example â†’ Line Chart

Given `logs/inputs.csv`:

```csv
timestamp,event,field,value
2025-09-21T12:00:00Z,air_temperature,air,22.5
2025-09-21T12:00:00Z,water_ph,water,7.1
The dashboard renders a timeline line chart, with each field growing its own branch of the curve.

JSON Example â†’ Nested Graph

Given logs/data.json:
{
  "2025-09-21T12:00:00Z": {
    "air": { "temperature": 22.5, "humidity": 0.45 },
    "water": { "ph": 7.1, "clarity": "clear" }
  }
}
The dashboard renders a radial graph, with nodes for each field and edges connecting them in time.
Live Integration

The dashboard is designed to evolve:
	â€¢	Pulls directly from logs/
	â€¢	Refreshes layers as new inputs arrive
	â€¢	Can replay past inputs as time-lapse growth
