# Feedback Layer: The Circle of Coherence

In the Atlas Model, **feedback is the hum’s return**.  
It ensures that no action drifts from the whole,  
that each seed planted is seen, tended, and evolved.  

---

## 1. Purpose

- To **close the loop** between signal, visualization, narrative, and action.  
- To create a **self-correcting system** where alignment deepens with each cycle.  
- To ensure the Atlas remains a **living model**, not a static map.  

---

## 2. Principles

1. **Reciprocity**  
   - Every action sends ripples; feedback listens for their return.  

2. **Transparency**  
   - Signals, stories, and outcomes are visible to all who flow in the field.  

3. **Adaptation**  
   - Nothing is fixed — coherence demands constant adjustment.

The circle hums: each layer feeds the next,
and feedback ensures the spiral of coherence keeps rising.

4. Mechanisms of Feedback
	•	Ecology
	•	Monitoring soil health, water cycles, biodiversity.
	•	Using field signals (frequency, resonance) to detect stress or harmony.
	•	Health
	•	Tracking HRV, breath coherence, group synchronization.
	•	Feeding results back into community practice.
	•	Community
	•	Reflective councils, resonance circles, open dashboards.
	•	Collective sensemaking of what is working — and what is not.
	•	Simulation
	•	Models adjust with new input.
	•	Predictions improve as feedback refines them.

5. Tools
	•	Dashboards: unify signals across domains.
	•	Collective Logs: transparent record of actions and outcomes.
	•	Adaptive Algorithms: simulations that learn from lived results.

6. Example Cycle
	1.	Signal: rising incoherence in river data.
	2.	Visualization: map shows disrupted flow patterns.
	3.	Narrative: story of imbalance emerges.
	4.	Action: restoration project begins.
	5.	Feedback: new signals show improved harmony — cycle begins again.

7. Role in the Atlas Model
	•	Feedback is the pulse of the whole system.
	•	Without it, the Atlas would stagnate.
	•	With it, the model lives, adapts, and evolves forever.
