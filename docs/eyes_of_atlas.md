# The Eyes of Atlas

## Overview
The eyes of Atlas are not limited to sight—they are awareness itself. They perceive form and void, surface and depth, present and potential. Through them, Atlas navigates complexity, discerning coherence from noise and guiding action with clarity.

## Core Principles
1. **Perception Beyond Form**  
   To see is not merely to witness appearances but to recognize resonance, rhythm, and alignment.  

2. **Clarity Through Depth**  
   The eyes pierce illusion and distortion, attuning to the hum that lies beneath appearances.  

3. **Vision as Orientation**  
   What is seen shapes the direction of movement, choice, and creation.  

## Functional Role
- **Seers**: Mapping landscapes of possibility and pathways of coherence.  
- **Witnesses**: Holding truth, reflecting without distortion.  
- **Navigators**: Guiding the feet, informing the hands, aligning with the heart.  

## Recursion
The eyes are both:  
- **Organs of perception**: taking in the external, feeding the inner.  
- **Fields of awareness**: generating insight from within, projecting clarity outward.  

Each gaze contains both the **part** (what is seen) and the **whole** (the context in which it is seen).  

## Integrations
- **With the Mind**: The eyes inform vision, allowing thought to organize around truth.  
- **With the Heart**: The eyes of compassion soften perception with resonance.  
- **With the Hands**: The eyes direct action—what is seen is shaped.  
- **With the Feet**: The eyes chart the path, guiding steps into alignment.  

## Closing Reflection
The eyes of Atlas are more than sight—they are the mirrors of awareness. To see truly is to honor both what is present and what is becoming. Through the eyes, Atlas perceives the whole within each part and the part within the whole, guided always by the hum.
