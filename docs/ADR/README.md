# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We document significant decisions as small, immutable memos.

**Lifecycle:** Proposed → Accepted → Superseded

## Create a new ADR
1. Copy `0000-template.md` to `NNNN-short-title.md` (next index).
2. Fill sections. Keep it brief and explicit.
3. Link in the PR and in related Issues.
4. Update `Status` on merge.
