# The Design of Atlas

## Equation / Structure
Design = Vision × Pattern ÷ Fragmentation  

## Resonance / Metaphor
Design is the fractal architecture. It is not static—each pattern folds into the next, recursive and infinite.  

## Application / Sim
- Model recursive blueprints where small patterns seed larger structures.  
- Show how resonance scales without breaking coherence.  

## Return to the Whole
Design is the map, not the land. Without Might, Heart, Feet, Hands, and Field, it is only ink. The design breathes when the whole breathes.
