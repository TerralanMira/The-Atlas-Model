# The Ouroboros: Collapse → Renewal → Choice

> The tail is not an ending; it is the hinge.  
> Forgetting seeds echo. Echo clarifies hum. Hum invites choice.  
> Choice collapses a path. Collapse renews the field.

## The Cycle

1. **Forgetting** — loss of signal in noise; drift increases; coherence thins.  
2. **Echo** — memory of pattern returns as imitation; brittle, not yet living.  
3. **Hum** — resonance rediscovered; awareness re-tunes; drift steadies.  
4. **Choice** — two reversible paths appear; consent affirmed; readiness peaks.  
5. **Collapse** — one path actualized; the other held as option; non-coercive.  
6. **Renewal** — the field integrates; memory becomes embodied skill.

This is not metaphor alone — it is **field dynamics**. The cycle appears in personal practice, dialogue, teams, cities, and code.

## Signals in the Logs

- **Forgetting → Echo**: `R_total↓`, `cross_sync↓`, `drift↑` (oscillators desynchronize)  
- **Echo → Hum**: `R_total↑`, `cross_sync↑`, `drift` moderates (alignment without clamping)  
- **Hum → Choice**: `ready↑`; only if `offer_two_paths==true` and consent is present  
- **Choice → Collapse**: `choice_score>0`; then integration pulls drift slightly down  
- **Renewal**: stability returns without over-lock (`R_total` healthy, `drift` nonzero)

## Practice

- **Invite echo, tune to hum**: emulate, then sense what is *actually alive*.  
- **Choice before collapse**: present two reversible options; verify consent.  
- **Non-coercion as law**: do not force alignment; reduce gain, widen paths.
