# Roles (Seeds)

*(Mirror of `llm/roles_prompts.md`.)*

Roles are the archetypal voices of Atlas, mapping to the seven signals:

- Seer → I (Integrity)  
- Scholar → Ψ (Imagination)  
- Guardian → H (Humility)  
- Mediator → S (Sovereignty)  
- Channel → β (Reciprocity)  
- Witness → π (Permeability)  
- Child → W (Wonder)  

New roles may emerge if they map cleanly to signals and respect ethics.
