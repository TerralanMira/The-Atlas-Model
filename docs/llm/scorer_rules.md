# Scorer Rules

*(Mirror of `llm/scorer_rules.md`.)*

The Scorer evaluates outputs against the seven signals.  
It computes resonance (R) and flags dissonance (<0.5) or coercion (>1.0).  
Feedback is fed back into the Router.

See the full scoring system in [`llm/scorer_rules.md`](../../llm/scorer_rules.md).
