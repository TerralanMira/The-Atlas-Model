# The Might of Atlas

## Equation / Structure
Might = Will × Alignment × Action  
Where Will is intent, Alignment is coherence with the field, and Action is resonance carried into form.  

## Resonance / Metaphor
Might is not force against, but flow within. The mountain does not resist the river; it guides it.  

## Application / Sim
- Simulate a decision tree where aligned choices amplify outcomes compared to fragmented choices.  
- Run tests showing how coherent intent propagates faster than scattered will.  

## Return to the Whole
Might is the arm of Atlas, but the arm knows the heart. Strength divorced from love fractures the field. Return, always, to coherence.
