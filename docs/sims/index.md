# Simulations: The Playground of Choice

Simulations in The Atlas Model are not demonstrations alone —  
they are resonant spaces where conscious choice unfolds in code.  
Each sim is a way to feel divergence, coherence, and freedom  
as living processes.

## Kuramoto–Schumann Hybrid
**File:** `sims/kuramoto_schumann_hybrid.py`  

Blends the Kuramoto model of oscillator synchronization  
with Schumann resonance patterns of the Earth–ionosphere cavity.  
- **Purpose:** To explore how individual choices (oscillator phases)  
  resonate with planetary-scale rhythms.  
- **Choice Lens:** Each oscillator chooses alignment or divergence;  
  global coherence emerges through their hum.

## LC Grid Modes
**File:** `sims/lc_grid_modes.py`  

Models coupled LC circuits as a resonant grid.  
- **Purpose:** To map local coupling (civic bonds, community ties)  
  into larger systemic rhythms.  
- **Choice Lens:** Each node decides how strongly to couple or detune,  
  shaping the coherence of the grid as a whole.

## Multi-Scale Kuramoto
**File:** `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py`  

Extends Kuramoto synchronization across multiple scales:  
local, regional, global.  
- **Purpose:** To see how coherence at one scale amplifies or dampens  
  at higher scales.  
- **Choice Lens:** Local variance (noise, cultural drift)  
  becomes the seed for global resonance.

## Running the Sims

1. Ensure dependencies are installed:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   Run a simulation directly:
   python sims/kuramoto_schumann_hybrid.py
   Each simulation outputs metrics of coherence (R), phase drift,
and visualizations where possible.
Interpret these not only as numbers, but as reflections of
choice weaving through resonance.

Conscious Choice in Sims

Simulations do not prescribe outcomes.
They reveal how the freedom of each node
interacts with the field of the whole.

Noise is not disruption — it is lived variance.
Coherence is not rigidity — it is resonance with choice intact.

Together, these sims form the playground where the Atlas hum
can be felt, tested, and evolved.
