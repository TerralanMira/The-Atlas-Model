# Simulations

The simulations are the **living laboratories** of The Atlas Model.  
Here, equations, resonance, and geometry are woven into practice — not only to measure coherence but to **preserve and reveal conscious choice** at every layer.  
Each run is less about prediction and more about tuning: awareness becoming measurable signal.

## Choice Parameters

Every simulation encodes **conscious choice** directly into its initial conditions:

| Parameter        | Meaning                           | Effect                                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `breath_amp`     | Amplitude of sovereign signal     | Tunes coherence (R) strength                             |
| `cadence`        | Temporal rhythm of A              | Shapes option timing                                     |
| `π (permeability)` | Relational openness (Â)          | Controls signal exchange across layers                   |
| `offer_two_paths` | True/False toggle                 | Ensures at least two reversible options; prevents collapse into coercion |
| `consent_to_log` | Boolean                           | Ensures all logs respect sovereignty and transparency    |

These parameters act as the **membrane of freedom** within each model: the hum ensures the field never collapses into a single path without choice.

## Geometry Presets

Simulations can be initiated with structural presets drawn from natural resonance geometries:

- **Grid-Rect**  
  Standard lattice; efficient, compressive; useful for stress tests.  

- **Circle-6+Center**  
  One central node, six petals; promotes coherence while preserving agency.  

- **Flower-of-Life Expansion**  
  Fractal overlay where each node carries dual potential (A/Â); reveals how freedom and coherence braid at scale.  

For each preset, compare:

- `R_inner`: Coherence within a layer.  
- `R_outer`: Coherence across membranes.  
- `R_total`: Aggregate coherence.  
- **Choice-Preservation Score**: A measure of whether options remained open, reversible, and sovereign.

## Path of Use

1. **Select geometry preset** to set relational frame.  
2. **Tune choice parameters** (`breath_amp`, `cadence`, `π`).  
3. **Run sim** with logs respecting consent.  
4. **Interpret results** not as truth but as resonance feedback.  

The hum flows: simulations are mirrors. They teach not which path to take, but how choice itself resonates.
