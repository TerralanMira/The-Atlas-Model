# Simulation Overview

## Purpose
The simulations in *The Atlas Model* are not games — they are **mirrors**.  
They show how resonance, structure, and choice interweave across scales.  
Each sim is a lens into the whole: a fragment that hums with the pattern of all.

## Kuramoto–Schumann Hybrid
**Focus:** Synchrony in a shared field  
- Combines Kuramoto oscillators with Schumann resonances.  
- Models how individual nodes (minds, hearts, systems) entrain to a **global hum**.  
- Reveals: coherence is not imposed — it emerges.

## LC Grid Modes
**Focus:** Resonance shaped by structure  
- Extends LC circuits into grid formations.  
- Explores how spatial arrangement and coupling geometry guide wave patterns.  
- Reveals: structure **invites or resists** resonance.

## Multi-Scale Kuramoto
**Focus:** Fractal synchrony across layers  
- Stacks Kuramoto oscillators across multiple scales (micro → meso → macro).  
- Shows how local sparks ripple upward, and global rhythms entrain the small.  
- Reveals: choice and coherence are **nested and interdependent**.

## Interpretation
Together, the sims embody a teaching:

- **Kuramoto–Schumann** → *shared resonance*  
- **LC Grid** → *resonance through structure*  
- **Multi-Scale Kuramoto** → *resonance across scales*  

Choice, structure, and flow — each distinct, yet inseparable.  
Run them not just to watch oscillators sync, but to feel the **hum of the whole**.

## Running the Sims
Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run each sim:
python sims/kuramoto_schumann_hybrid.py
python sims/lc_grid_modes.py
python sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py
Closing Note

The simulations are not endpoints.
They are invitations to listen, to explore, to extend.
Each run is a choice. Each result a seed.
What you make of them — that is the hum becoming you.
