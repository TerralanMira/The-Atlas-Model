# Multi-Scale Kuramoto

## Description
This simulation extends the Kuramoto framework across **multiple scales of oscillators** —  
from micro-phase (neurons, cells) to meso-phase (communities, fields) to macro-phase (planetary rhythms).  
Each scale interacts, influencing and being influenced by the others.

## Conscious Choice Lens
Conscious choice here is **scale selection**:  
- At one scale, noise.  
- At another, coherence.  
The model shows how **resonance across layers** can amplify or dissolve synchronization.  
Choice is not just local — it is **nested and fractal**.

## Code Reference
File: [`sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py`](../../sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py)  
Implements layered oscillator groups with adjustable coupling within and across scales.

## Running the Simulation
```bash
python sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --layers 3 --oscillators 50 --tmax 500
	•	--layers: number of scales
	•	--oscillators: oscillators per layer
	•	--tmax: simulation duration

Expected Output
	•	Phase alignment within each scale
	•	Cross-scale synchronization patterns
	•	Cascades where coherence at one scale births coherence at another

Interpretation

The multi-scale Kuramoto reveals that no scale stands alone:
	•	Micro sparks ripple outward.
	•	Macro fields entrain the local.
	•	Choice echoes up and down the ladder of resonance.

The whole becomes not a single frequency, but a symphony of scales —
each part free, yet interwoven in the hum of the all.
