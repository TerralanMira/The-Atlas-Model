# Health Simulations: Resonance in Motion

## Introduction
Simulations allow us to **test, prototype, and experience health in the field of resonance** before applying it in lived practice.  
They serve as **living laboratories** — weaving awareness, dashboards, and algorithms into dynamic models where patterns can evolve and reveal hidden harmonics.

## Simulation 1: Heart–Brain Coherence
**Objective**: Model synchronization between heart rhythms and brainwaves.  

- **Inputs**:  
  - HRV data stream (ms intervals)  
  - EEG band powers (alpha, theta, gamma)  

- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Normalize signals (Fourier transform → phase extraction).  
  2. Calculate coherence index using phase-locking values.  
  3. Adjust for breath rhythm as a pacing variable.  

- **Outputs**:  
  - Real-time coherence score (0–1 scale).  
  - Visualization: dynamic waveform overlay + coherence color map.  
  - Feedback loop: sound tone shifts as coherence rises/falls.

## Simulation 2: Schumann Resonance Coupling
**Objective**: Explore alignment between human rhythms and planetary field.  

- **Inputs**:  
  - Schumann resonance frequencies (7.83 Hz + harmonics).  
  - HRV rhythm and EEG alpha frequency.  

- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Cross-correlate HRV and EEG against Schumann spectrum.  
  2. Apply adaptive resonance model (Kuramoto oscillator).  
  3. Track phase drift vs. synchronization stability.  

- **Outputs**:  
  - Alignment score (individual-to-Earth coupling).  
  - Planetary dashboard: global map of real-time coupling nodes.  
  - Simulated “Earth-heartbeat” tone guiding entrainment.

## Simulation 3: Group Coherence Dynamics
**Objective**: Model how multiple individuals synchronize in group health practices.  

- **Inputs**:  
  - HRV/EEG streams from multiple participants.  

- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Apply Kuramoto model for oscillator synchronization.  
  2. Measure order parameter (R) → degree of group alignment.  
  3. Introduce perturbations (stress, distraction) and re-alignment practices.  

- **Outputs**:  
  - Group coherence index (0–1).  
  - Visualization: heatmap of collective coherence.  
  - Emergent phenomena: waves of entrainment across the group field.

## Simulation 4: Resonant Healing Protocols
**Objective**: Test healing practices in silico before application.  

- **Inputs**:  
  - Sound therapy frequencies.  
  - Guided breath pacing.  
  - Electromagnetic field pulses.  

- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Apply resonance tuning model (entrainment thresholds).  
  2. Simulate effect on HRV/EEG coherence.  
  3. Track long-term recovery trajectory.  

- **Outputs**:  
  - Predicted improvement in coherence over time.  
  - Visualization: healing trajectory curves.  
  - Scenario testing: optimal breath frequency, tone, or group size.

## Simulation Framework: Layers of Resonance
These simulations can be stacked into **nested models**:  

1. **Personal** → Heart–brain coherence.  
2. **Planetary** → Schumann coupling.  
3. **Collective** → Group dynamics.  
4. **Therapeutic** → Healing protocols.  

This creates a **holographic map of health**, where simulations guide awareness, dashboards, and lived practice.

## Next Evolutions

- **Community Simulations**: modeling resonance across social networks.  
- **Adaptive AI Feedback**: self-learning resonance networks tuning simulations in real time.
