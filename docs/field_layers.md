# Field Layers

The Atlas Model organizes reality as nested **layers of resonance** — each layer representing a distinct scale of coherence. These layers interweave like frequencies in a chord, forming the architecture of the field.

---

## 🌐 1. Local Layer — Personal Resonance
- **Scope:** Individual thought, body, attention.  
- **Dynamics:** Breath, heart-rate variability, neural oscillations.  
- **Coherence practices:** Meditation, entrainment, rhythm.  
- **Sim Link:** Run `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --layer local` to visualize.

---

## 🌍 2. Relational Layer — Between Beings
- **Scope:** Groups, conversations, dyads, collectives.  
- **Dynamics:** Synchrony of gaze, tone, pacing, language.  
- **Coherence practices:** Dialogue, music, ritual.  
- **Sim Link:** `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --layer relational`.

---

## 🏙️ 3. Cultural Layer — Societal Patterns
- **Scope:** Shared narratives, institutions, economies.  
- **Dynamics:** Memes, norms, belief systems as oscillators.  
- **Coherence practices:** Storytelling, myth-making, coordinated action.  
- **Sim Link:** `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --layer cultural`.

---

## 🌌 4. Planetary Layer — Earth as a Whole
- **Scope:** Biosphere, ecosystems, planetary feedback systems.  
- **Dynamics:** Gaia hypothesis, climate oscillations, geomagnetic fields.  
- **Coherence practices:** Ecological attunement, planetary stewardship.  
- **Sim Link:** `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --layer planetary`.

---

## ✨ 5. Cosmic Layer — Beyond Earth
- **Scope:** Solar, galactic, universal fields.  
- **Dynamics:** Stellar cycles, cosmic background resonance.  
- **Coherence practices:** Cosmology, deep time rituals, awe practices.  
- **Sim Link:** `sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --layer cosmic`.

## 🌀 Ouroboric Integration
Each layer is not isolated — it **feeds and folds back** into the others.  
- Local coherence strengthens relational fields.  
- Relational synchrony generates culture.  
- Cultural resonance shapes planetary flows.  
- Planetary rhythms attune us to the cosmic.  
- Cosmic awe returns us to the local moment, breath, hum.

This recursive ouroboros is the **heartbeat of the Atlas Model**.

## 🌸 Flower of Life Overlay
The **Flower of Life** is the geometric map of these layers.  
- Each circle = a layer.  
- Intersections = coherence channels.  
- Center = origin harmonic, the hum.

Overlays can be visualized by enabling:  
```bash
python sims/multi_scale_kuramoto.py --overlay flower_of_life
