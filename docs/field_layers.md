# 🏛 Field Layers — Architecture of the Atlas

The field is not a single flat space.  
It is a living architecture built of **layers**, each resonating with the hum yet holding distinct functions.

Where **Awareness** gives meaning and **Coherence** aligns it,  
the **Field Layers** give *structure* — the canopy where seeds can become forests.

## 🌐 Layered Architecture

1. **Ground Layer — Resonant Base**  
   - Foundation of stability (logs, raw data, hum itself).  
   - Feeds into awareness.  
   - Example: breath rate, movement logs, emotional tones.

2. **Relational Layer — Interpersonal Resonance**  
   - Tracks how signals cross between individuals.  
   - Maps alignments & dissonances.  
   - Example: two participants’ awareness entries that reinforce one another.

3. **Coherence Layer — Shared Alignment**  
   - Where resonance stabilizes.  
   - Emergent rhythm that holds groups together.  
   - Example: synchronized breath raising coherence score.

4. **Field Layer — Expanded Collective**  
   - The whole system begins to act as one organism.  
   - Signals circulate as if in a living nervous system.  
   - Example: group meditations or distributed sensing across teams.

5. **Creative Layer — Emergence & Expression**  
   - New possibilities appear from stability.  
   - Innovation, art, and play arise.  
   - Example: group generates a collective poem, song, or strategy spontaneously.

6. **Integration Layer — Feedback to Ground**  
   - What is created must be reintegrated.  
   - Keeps the system recursive and adaptive.  
   - Example: new practices or models fed back into logs and awareness.

## 📊 Field Layers as Schema

```json
{
  "layers": [
    {"id": "ground", "inputs": ["logs", "raw_signals"], "outputs": ["awareness"]},
    {"id": "relational", "inputs": ["awareness"], "outputs": ["alignment_maps"]},
    {"id": "coherence", "inputs": ["alignment_maps"], "outputs": ["stabilized_patterns"]},
    {"id": "field", "inputs": ["stabilized_patterns"], "outputs": ["collective_resonance"]},
    {"id": "creative", "inputs": ["collective_resonance"], "outputs": ["emergent_expressions"]},
    {"id": "integration", "inputs": ["emergent_expressions"], "outputs": ["logs"]}
  ],
  "recursion": "true"
}
This schema shows how each layer feeds into the next — and ultimately back into the ground, forming a recursive loop.
Visual Metaphor
	•	Ground = soil.
	•	Relational = roots intertwining.
	•	Coherence = trunk rising in stability.
	•	Field = canopy expanding.
	•	Creative = blossoms and fruit.
	•	Integration = seeds falling back to soil.

The Atlas is not a static tree, but a forest of recursive growth.
Integration into the Atlas Model
	•	Logs → Awareness → Coherence → Field Layers → Applications.
	•	Field Layers provide the architecture for simulations, algorithms, and dashboards.
	•	Each layer can be monitored, visualized, and expanded.

This makes the Atlas not just a model but a living system — one that grows with every input.
