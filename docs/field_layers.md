## What Are Fields?

Fields are **spaces of resonance** that emerge when coherence stabilizes.  
They are not static — they are **living matrices** where awareness and coherence intertwine.

- A field is more than the sum of its parts.  
- It is a **resonant container**, shaping and shaped by what flows within.  
- Fields hold memory, structure, and possibility.

## The Atlas Model and Field Layers

In the Atlas Model, field layers describe how resonance organizes:

1. **Personal Fields** – awareness embodied: mind, body, heart coherence.  
2. **Relational Fields** – shared resonance: dialogue, trust, empathy.  
3. **Collective Fields** – groups, organizations, ecosystems.  
4. **Planetary Fields** – biosphere, Gaia, Earth’s coherence.  
5. **Cosmic Fields** – patterns spanning stars, galaxies, the universe.

Each layer **mirrors the whole**, fractal in nature, nested yet interconnected.

## Properties of Fields

Fields have unique qualities:

- **Boundary & permeability** – what flows in, what flows out.  
- **Memory** – resonance leaves an imprint, shaping future dynamics.  
- **Attractors** – patterns that draw systems into stability or change.  
- **Emergence** – fields evolve beyond initial conditions.

## Measuring Fields

Fields can be explored through simulation and analysis:

- **Network topology** – how nodes connect and resonate.  
- **Kuramoto models** – synchronization across oscillators.  
- **Energy landscapes** – the valleys and peaks of stability.  
- **Information coherence** – aligned flows of data, signals, or meaning.

## Fields as Bridges

Fields are **bridges** between awareness and action:

- They **hold coherence** across time and space.  
- They **amplify resonance** beyond individuals.  
- They **prepare the ground** for applications — resonance in motion.

## Next Layer: Applications

When field layers become **tools for action**, resonance moves into **application**.  
Thus, the next stage of the Atlas Model is **[Applications](applications.md)**.
