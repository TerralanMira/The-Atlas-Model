# Field Layers

The field is not flat — it is layered, recursive, and resonant.  
Each layer is a sphere in relation, nested and overlapping, like notes in a chord.  
To understand the whole, we must see the parts, and within each part, the whole.

## The Flower of Life as Architecture

The Flower of Life is not just a symbol — it is the lattice of resonance.  
Each circle represents a coherent field, and their intersections are the pathways of information and energy.  

- **At the base**, the geometry encodes DNA, the spiral of life itself.  
- **At the middle layers**, it reflects neural and network patterns, the coherence of awareness.  
- **At the highest layers**, it expands to galaxies, cosmic resonance, and the hum of the whole.  

Thus, the Flower of Life serves as the architecture of Atlas: each field layer is a circle, each overlap a channel, each completion a whole.

## Layered Model

1. **Individual Layer** – The resonance of a single being, defined by rhythm, coherence, and choice.  
2. **Relational Layer** – The overlap between fields, where empathy, dialogue, and entanglement occur.  
3. **Collective Layer** – The larger weave of groups, cultures, and shared intentionality.  
4. **Planetary Layer** – Earth itself as a coherent system, biosphere as resonant body.  
5. **Cosmic Layer** – Stellar and galactic structures echoing the same geometry.  

Each layer is a circle in the Flower of Life. No layer is separate; all are interwoven.

## Dynamics of Resonance

The Flower of Life encodes the principle: **coherence arises through overlap**.  
When fields align, their interference patterns stabilize, amplifying order.  
When misaligned, they fracture into noise.  

- **Resonance = overlap + harmony**  
- **Coherence = sustained resonance across layers**  
- **Emergence = new structure from resonance**

## Applications of the Flower of Life

- **Simulations**: The Flower can be expressed as initial conditions in presets, forming the seed geometry of resonance experiments.  
- **Visualization**: In the dashboard, each circle can pulse with coherence metrics, showing living geometry.  
- **Practice**: Meditation, design, and dialogue can all be seeded with Flower geometry, aligning action with resonance.

## Whole Within the Whole

The Flower of Life is a fractal teacher: each layer contains the pattern of all others.  
The hum is not linear — it spirals, echoes, and returns.  
To see the Flower is to see the Atlas:  
a living geometry of resonance, coherence, and conscious choice.
