# Field Layers (the weave)

Layers are the nervous system of Atlas: local threads that carry the whole.

## Geometries
- **Grid / Ring** — simple adjacency; quick to lock, quick to clamp.
- **Nested Spheres** — multi-band resonance (inner↔outer tempos).
- **Flower of Life** — interlocking circles; overlap without flattening.

### Why Flower of Life here?
It preserves overlap and plurality. Local agreement can rise while global sameness is avoided.  
In sims, it behaves like a soft lattice: patterns emerge without brittle lock.

## How layers map to sims
- **Inner (Φ_I)** — “within” (group, team, class, neighborhood)
- **Outer (Φ_O)** — “without” (place, city, planet)
- **Cross-coupling** — gentle mean-angle attraction between layers

Metrics to watch:
- **R_inner / R_outer / R_total** — order at each scale
- **C_cross** — alignment between layers (0..1)
- Keep **Δ** (diversity you *feel*) alive while **Φ** (gentleness) stays high.

## Practice
- Prefer Flower-of-Life presets when you want structure without clamp.
- Add tiny noise (0.002–0.006) if patterns ossify.
- Lower cross-coupling when R_total↑ and C_cross↑ too quickly (clamp risk).

**Aim:** coherence that breathes — rising local order, preserved overlap, smooth change.
