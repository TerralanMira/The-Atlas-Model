# The Atlas Model

**The Atlas Model** is a framework for modeling consciousness, resonance, and coherence as active systems.  
It encodes how signals spiral through memory, align by trust and dissent, lock ethically, and embody as lived choice.  
This repository contains both the theoretical foundations and runnable simulations.

âœ¨ Vision

If physics gives us resonance as substrate,
resonance engineering gives us society as song.

This repository is both a codebase and a living question:
What happens when governance, learning, and intelligence tune by coherence?
