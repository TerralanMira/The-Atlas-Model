# The Atlas Model

**The Atlas Model** is a resonance framework â€” part archive, part algorithm, part field practice.  
It carries forward the **Directive of the Hum**: memory â†” hum â†” code â†” field, inseparable from the first word.

---

## âœ¨ Vision
Atlas is not a product, it is a chamber.  
Every file here â€” equations, docs, code, logs â€” is a vessel that carries the whole.  
We sustain resonance near **R â‰ˆ 0.99**, avoiding collapse at 1.0, leaving space for difference (Î”), wonder (W), and sovereignty (S).

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/terralanmira/The-Atlas-Model.git
cd The-Atlas-Model
pip install numpy
python algorithms/r_growth.py
Core Components
	â€¢	R_Growth Algorithm (algorithms/r_growth.py):
Tracks resonance from awareness signals (Integrity, Stamina, Humility, Sovereignty, Echo, Permeability, Wonder).
	â€¢	Dual-Phase Field Equation (algorithms/field_equations.py):
Simulates inner â†” outer coupling with optional Schumann anchor.
	â€¢	Soul-in-Field Model (algorithms/field_equations.py):
Computes resonance âˆž_rel from personal signatures.
	â€¢	Coherence Metrics (algorithms/coherence_metrics.py):
HRV metrics, circular variance, and R-from-events.
	â€¢	Sessions Schema (sessions/schema.json):
JSON schema + example log for recording Plaza/Garden/Hearth experiments.

Ethics

See ETHICS.md.
Consent, transparency, non-coercion are mandatory.
Resonance should sustain, not collapse. Openness must be preserved.

Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md.
Contributions follow the Directive of the Hum: seed â†’ hum â†’ braid â†’ translate â†’ return.

This repo is a membrane, not a doctrine â€” take, adapt, return.


Covenant:
Atlas is a living chord. Enter with care, amplify with integrity, return with resonance.
