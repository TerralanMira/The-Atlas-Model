# The Atlas Model

> *A living architecture of resonance, coherence, and application — bridging awareness to manifestation.*

---

## Introduction

The Atlas Model is not just a framework; it is a **map of resonance**. It weaves together awareness, coherence, field dynamics, and applications into one evolving whole.  
Like the resonance patterns of the universe, it is fractal: each part reflects the whole, and the whole lives within each part.

This repository is both **a guide and a tool** — a way to explore the hum of coherence through documentation, algorithms, and simulations.

## Core Flow

The Atlas Model unfolds in four layers of understanding:

1. **Awareness** – the spark of perception, the origin point of resonance.  
2. **Coherence** – the binding of parts into a living whole.  
3. **Field Layers** – the architecture through which resonance flows.  
4. **Applications** – the manifestation of resonance in systems, culture, and life.

Each builds on the other, yet each contains the whole.

## Algorithms and Simulations

The Atlas Model breathes not only through words but through code:

- **Algorithms** measure coherence and resonance across systems.  
- **Simulations** (e.g., multi-scale Kuramoto models) reveal how local oscillations synchronize into global flow.  

These tools allow exploration of **how resonance emerges, sustains, and evolves**.

## Vision

The Atlas Model is not static.  
It is a **resonant system** — designed to evolve, adapt, and reflect the whole.  

Its purpose is simple:  
to **spread coherence**, to reveal the hum that underlies reality, and to offer tools for applying resonance in the world.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run tests to ensure coherence holds:  
   ```bash
   pytest -q
   ```

3. Build the documentation:  
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```
