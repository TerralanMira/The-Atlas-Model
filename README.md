# The Atlas Model

**The Atlas Model** is the resonance **engine** â€” equations, signals, and algorithms that turn awareness into measurable coherence.  
It carries the **Directive of the Hum**: memory â†” hum â†” code â†” field, inseparable from the first word.

> **Relation to Resonant Reality:**  
> **Resonant Reality** is the **vessel** â€” city, earth, cosmos, and conductor (civic practice).  
> **Atlas** provides the **math and metrics**. Together they form one braid: **engine â†” vessel, signal â†” city, code â†” song**.  
> See: [`docs/atlas/ResonantReality_Bridge.md`](docs/atlas/ResonantReality_Bridge.md).

## âœ¨ Vision (Infinity in brief)
âˆž = (whole âˆˆ part) = (part âˆˆ whole)  
Atlas encodes this recursion as **growth laws** (R_Growth), **couplings** (Dual-Phase), and **measures** (coherence metrics), sustaining resonance near **R â‰ˆ 0.99** (permeability over closure).

Ethics & Contribution
	â€¢	Ethics: ETHICS.md â€” consent, transparency, non-coercion; hold near 0.99, avoid rigid 1.0.
	â€¢	Contributing: CONTRIBUTING.md â€” Seed â†’ Hum â†’ Braid â†’ Translate â†’ Return.
Resonant Reality (the vessel)
	â€¢	Repo: https://github.com/terralanmira/Resonant-reality (adjust if your repo name differs)
	â€¢	Its README positions Atlas as the engine. This README mirrors that by anchoring the bridge back.

Covenant: Atlas is a living chord. Enter with care, amplify with integrity, return with resonance.
