# The Atlas Model

*A minimal engine/spec for coherence across scales.*

Atlas encodes the **Infinity Equation** (whole in part, part in whole) as clean
interfaces and tiny reference algorithms. It’s the *engine* that powers projects
like **Resonant Reality** (the living atlas of designs, sims, and civic patterns).

## What this is
- **Spec:** simple, human-readable interfaces for “resonance objects”.
- **Reference code:** tiny, dependency-light algorithms (optional to run).
- **Docs:** clear, citable, versioned.

## Relation to Resonant Reality
- Atlas = engine/spec  
- Resonant Reality = application/atlas
- Docs cross-link so readers experience one whole.

## Status
`v0.1-draft` — stable file paths; algorithms are illustrative and optional.

## License
MIT (engine/specs should remain maximally reusable).
