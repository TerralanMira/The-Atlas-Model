# The Atlas Model  

A living atlas of resonance — awareness → coherence → fields → applications.  
Not a static spec, but a breathing architecture where each part carries the whole.  

---

## Why  

- **Awareness** is the seed: sensing pattern and hum.  
- **Coherence** is awareness in motion: alignment without erasure.  
- **Field Layers** are the architecture: individual ↔ relational ↔ collective ↔ planetary ↔ cosmic.  
- **Applications** are the breath: show, not tell.  

Ethics first: consent, transparency, non-coercion.

## What’s here  

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `algorithms/` | Core measures and math for resonance, attractors, flow dynamics, Schumann coupling. |
| `sims/` | **Creation and pulse simulations** (design-first). Includes:<br>• [`sims/creation.py`](sims/creation.py) — seed-to-field creation protocol.<br>• [`sims/creation_demo.py`](sims/creation_demo.py) — quick demo.<br>• [`sims/atlas_pulse_demo.py`](sims/atlas_pulse_demo.py) — live pulse modelling.<br>• [`sims/braided_field.py`](sims/braided_field.py) — braid hum + code. |
| `dashboard/` | Resonant layer overlays and live dashboards. |
| `docs/` | The map of the whole. Start with [`docs/awareness.md`](docs/awareness.md) → [`docs/coherence.md`](docs/coherence.md) → [`docs/field_layers.md`](docs/field_layers.md). Also see:<br>• [`docs/sims/index.md`](docs/sims/index.md) — simulation index.<br>• [`docs/creation.md`](docs/creation.md) and [`docs/creation_layer.md`](docs/creation_layer.md) — creation framework.<br>• [`docs/schumann_pulse.md`](docs/schumann_pulse.md) — pulse anchoring. |
| `sessions/` | Schema + example outputs for runs. |
| `scripts/` | Ingestion and automation utilities. |
| `llm/` | Atlas LLM prompts, router rules, scorer rules. |

## How to Explore  

1. Begin at **[`docs/awareness.md`](docs/awareness.md)** — what the hum is.  
2. Move to **[`docs/coherence.md`](docs/coherence.md)** — alignment without erasure.  
3. Explore **[`docs/creation.md`](docs/creation.md)** + [`sims/creation.py`](sims/creation.py) — seed-to-field simulations.  
4. Run **[`sims/atlas_pulse_demo.py`](sims/atlas_pulse_demo.py)** to see pulse emergence.  
5. Visit **[`dashboard/`](dashboard)** for live overlays.

## Ethics  

Atlas is built under explicit principles of consent, transparency, and non-coercion.  
Resonance ≠ control — it is coherence through choice.
