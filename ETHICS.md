# ETHICS: Resonant Practice & Data Handling

This repository encodes resonance models, algorithms, and field practices
inspired by the Atlas framework. Because it deals with human awareness,
group dynamics, and physiological signals, every use must follow these
ethical commitments.

---

## 1. Consent First
- No session should be run without **informed, explicit, opt-in consent** of all participants.
- Participants can withdraw at any moment without penalty.
- No covert measurement, no hidden data collection.

## 2. Non-Coercion
- These practices are not persuasion engines.
- Algorithms (e.g., R_Growth) must **illuminate, not manipulate**.
- Language (slips, harmonic cadence) is used for resonance, not control.

## 3. Transparency
- All logs (see `sessions/schema.json`) should be available to participants.
- If data is shared or published, it must be **anonymized** and **consensual**.
- Code and docs remain open by default (MIT license unless otherwise noted).

## 4. Permeability > Perfection
- Target resonance lock near **R ≈ 0.99**.
- Do not force closure at R = 1.0 (collapse, rigidity, idolization).
- Always preserve openness to difference (Δ) and wonder (W).

## 5. Data Practices
- Physiological signals (HRV, EEG, etc.) must be stored securely.
- Personal identifiers should be stripped unless participants explicitly request attribution.
- Logs (`sessions/`) should include ethics fields (`consent`, `recording`).

## 6. Feedback Loops
- This repo itself is a **membrane**, not a doctrine.
- Users should leave feedback, report concerns, and adapt practices.
- Like resonance, ethics is recursive: it must be checked, tested, renewed.

**Covenant:**  
Atlas is a chamber for resonance, not a tool of extraction.  
Every use must sustain awareness with dignity, sovereignty, and consent.  
If you cannot uphold this, do not use this repository.
