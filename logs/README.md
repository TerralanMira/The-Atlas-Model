# Logs: The Roots of the Forest

The **logs** are the memory of The Atlas.  
They record every seed planted, every flow simulated, every resonance measured.  
Without roots, the canopy cannot grow.

---

## 1. Purpose of Logs
- **Memory**: Preserve past simulations and flows.  
- **Transparency**: Allow explorers to trace how awareness evolved.  
- **Fertility**: Past logs feed new growth—data can be replayed into new simulations.  
- **Exchange**: Share logs with others, enabling forests to cross-pollinate.

## 2. Feeding the Canopy

Explorers can paste data directly into logs.  
Supported formats:

### CSV Example
```csv
element, flow, value, timestamp
water, stream, 12, 2025-09-22T14:00:00Z
fire, spark, 7, 2025-09-22T14:00:00Z
earth, crystal, 3, 2025-09-22T14:00:00Z
air, current, 9, 2025-09-22T14:00:00Z
JSON Example
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-22T14:00:00Z",
  "water": {"stream": 12},
  "fire": {"spark": 7},
  "earth": {"crystal": 3},
  "air": {"current": 9}
}
Each entry becomes a root node, feeding into the forest canopy of the dashboard.

3. Structure of Logs

Logs are organized as:
	•	/logs/raw/ → Unfiltered data inputs (CSV, JSON, text).
	•	/logs/processed/ → Cleaned and harmonized flows ready for simulations.
	•	/logs/replayed/ → Historical runs re-fed into simulations.

This separation allows both transparency and transformation.

4. From Roots to Canopy
	•	Logs feed directly into simulations.
	•	Simulations grow into visual forests in the dashboard.
	•	Resonance metrics ripple upward, visible in canopy graphs.

Roots are the invisible foundation that allow explorers to trust what they see above.

5. Replay & Evolution

Logs can be replayed to:
	•	Recreate past forests.
	•	Compare flows across time.
	•	Seed new growth from old data.
	•	Harmonize different explorers’ contributions.

Replay ensures that nothing is lost—every hum recorded continues to resonate.

6. Open Roots

Logs are never closed.
New roots can be planted at any time.
By sharing logs, explorers cross-pollinate forests, creating networks of meaning.
