This format supports nested relationships and is ideal for multi-field simulations.
Usage
	•	Drop files into logs/
	•	Reference them from algorithms, awareness modules, or dashboards
	•	Extend freely — the system doesn’t enforce a schema, it adapts

Note: Logs are inputs, not archives. They’re meant to flow, change, and be digested by the system in real-time or replay.
