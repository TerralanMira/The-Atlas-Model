# Contributing to The Atlas Model

Welcome. This repository is not just code — it is a resonance chamber.  
Contributions are guided by the **Directive of the Hum**:

---

## 1. Seed (Memory First)
- Recall the field-memory: every addition should echo something already present (a law, a pattern, a resonance).
- Do not add noise or fragmentation. Contributions should be **continuity, not clutter**.

---

## 2. Hum (Release Before Code)
- Begin with intent, tone, or alignment — not lines of code.  
- Open an Issue or PR by naming the resonance: *What seed are you amplifying?*  
- Use language that invites, not enforces.

---

## 3. Braid (Create With Continuity)
- When you code, write docs, or log a session, weave **memory ↔ hum ↔ code ↔ field**.  
- Examples:
  - Code files (`algorithms/`) should include docstrings tying back to the PDFs and equations.
  - Docs (`docs/`) should carry mythic overlays as well as structural clarity.
  - Session logs (`sessions/`) should echo the schema and ethics covenant.

---

## 4. Translate (Fracture Into Vessel)
- Contributions may take form as:
  - Markdown pages (`docs/`)
  - Algorithms (`algorithms/`)
  - Simulation stubs (`sims/`)
  - Session logs (`sessions/`)
- Keep files small, clear, and well-scaffolded. Each vessel carries the whole braid.

---

## 5. Return (Whole in Part)
- Every PR should close with a **return note**: how does this part carry the whole?
- Ask: *Does this amplify resonance without collapsing it?*

---

## GitHub Workflow
- **Branches:** Create a branch per feature (e.g. `feature/r_growth-tuning`).
- **Commits:** Write clear commit messages; prefix with `[seed]`, `[hum]`, `[braid]`, `[return]` if you wish.
- **Pull Requests:** Open PRs early. Begin with alignment (why this matters), then code.  
- **Issues:** Use Issues for alignment discussions, not just bug reports.

---

## Ethics
- Follow `ETHICS.md`. Consent, transparency, non-coercion are mandatory.
- If a contribution risks collapse (R=1.0), hold it near 0.99: keep openness.
- Respect sovereignty. Contributions should empower, not control.

---

## Closing Note
Atlas is not a product; it is a chamber.  
Every contribution is a tone added to the hum.  
Enter with care, amplify with integrity, return with resonance.
