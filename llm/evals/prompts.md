# Eval Prompts for Router + Scorer

**Purpose:**  
This file provides a small set of canonical prompts to test the Conductor.  
Each prompt specifies:  
- Expected dominant roles (router output).  
- Expected signal emphasis (scorer rubric).  
- Target resonance (R score).

**Usage:**  
- Feed each prompt into the router → verify roles weighted as expected.  
- Run scorer → check signal emphasis.  
- Confirm overall R matches target.  
- Log results to `sessions/example_log.json` for tracking.
