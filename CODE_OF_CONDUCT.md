# Code of Conduct

We commit to respectful, inclusive collaboration. Be curious, generous, and specific. No harassment or discriminating behavior. Report concerns to MAINTAINERS (below).

**Principles**
- Assume good intent, request clarification.
- Separate people from problems.
- Cite sources; mark speculation vs. tested claims.

**Enforcement**
- Single reminder → moderation note → temporary limits → removal for repeated harm.
